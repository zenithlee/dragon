Regarding doing testing on very complex meshes without Colliders (150k tris worth of MeshColliders is definitely not going to end in good things) is to render the scene to a render target with replacement shaders. Give each object a 24 bit ID. Then Render the scene to a RenderTarget with each selectable object being rendered. Set the colour in the replacement shader to be R = the first 8 bits of the ID, G = the next 8 bits, B = the last 8 bits. Then get the pixel that was clicked on in the scene and convert it's RGB value into a 24bit value (stack the 3 values one after another). Then you can retrieve the object clicked on based on ID. This allows you to have 16 777 216 unique objects (if you need less you can only use a single channel). And will remove the massive weight you are putting on the physics system. It will also reuse the skinning done for rendering the actual frame.
