Prologue

  “Send him!”

The Council Members grumbled in unity, not pleased with the current cluttered and thick documents on the stony circular table. Their eyes stared blankly at the documents centred in the middle of the table, none of them had bothered to read the documents but they all knew of the troublesome Section 3.4.3.1. It was apparently highlighted in bright red on page 1 690 of the Fourth of Twenty Auditors Report. The only reason they had been made aware of this was because of their secretary, Miss Underwood. She had issued an urgent meeting request in big bold letters stating the difficult nagging challenge known as Section 3.4.3.1.

"Send him."

Their grumblings echoed in different tones, One in soprano, the Second in tenor, the Third in contralto, the Forth in baritone and finally, the Fifth sat silent. The Council consisted of five old entities, they were created since the beginning of everything, before space collided with time and the universe began. They knew of the universe and what it stood for - a big lie with subtle truths hidden somewhere within the expanding universe.

"Send him."

The sounds of disgruntlement formed a melancholy melody that vibrated in the dark room. The Council gathered, every one of them dressed in their overgrown robes that fell from their chairs to the ground, giving the black tiled floor warmth. 
They sat with their hands and elbows resting on the stony table. Their features were barely visible in the dark, yet even in the light their faces were hidden by the grey hoods attached to their robes, the only visible trait was their scaly pale skin, if ever curious eyes had dared analyse their faces. 
But the Fifth one was entirely different, he was the oddest one of the five. He was dressed in a thin black hooded robe which hid his features well, he had no pale or scaly skin, within his hood was an abyss of nothingness where his face should have been.
Five doors stood behind their chairs and beyond them dim, glowing white lights shone. They had arrived to discuss Section 3.4.3.1, that apparently had to do with a few discrepancies of the Fifth one. According to the heavy documented reports that none of them had read, the discrepancies were based on the lack of energy balance in the universe. There were graphs, charts and pointy round things that hinted this was entirely the fault or the responsibility of the Fifth member, the pages dragged on and on and on to at least two hundred pages. But the Four Council Members were not interested, they shrugged their shoulders on their chairs, thinking this matter had been resolved, their two musical notes muttered in harmony.

“Send him!”

The Council Members hated light, it hurt their eyes. Except, once again, for the Fifth one. The light never bothered him but the Council business did. He did not like this Council production nor did he enjoy much of his work. He had forgotten how to speak because of this terrible dark occupation yet he had been doing it forever, since the collision of space and time. It was the only thing he had known until he had lifted his pen and forced the ink to create words on paper, this had occurred during the millions of years after the whole encrypted universe had been formed, on this one particular day, he had surprisingly lost his voice and had to make use of his pen and scribble notes.
It was somewhat a blessing, if one were to call it that. Without his voice, he had no alternative except to write. This encouraged him to improve his handwriting. Handwriting that his son had complimented him on sarcastically. But never mind that, he was delighted, he had become accustomed to the flow of writing and never left home without his pen, ink and paper. Yet, to his amazement, in this dark room where all Five members gathered and could easily see through the shadowy darkness, he had forgotten his pen, he had forgotten his ink.
He had forgotten his only real voice. 
The Council Members stood, assuming the Fifth member had agreed to the solution on Section 3.4.3.1. They stretched their long, grey, woolly robes, feeling tired and weary. They all hesitated at first, each of their hands on the silver handles of their respective doors, they were not eager to return to the dim lights outside the room, they were longing for a different scenery to the ancient scaly faces they were accustomed to. 
The Fifth one still sat, he heard his fellow Council Members push down the silver handles and depart. He sat alone for a few moments, his mind in deep thought, contemplating how he was going to send his only son down to the green pits of Earth to solve the highlighted red Section 3.4.3.1.
Chapter 1
'Death is already dead'

And so the story begins on a small planet named Earth, in a non-existent city named Raines. It was your average city filled with many suburbs, huge skyscrapers, millions of streets, many windows and random people minding their own business, more interested in their own lives than the lives of others. They arrogantly walked around Green Street, raising their noses in disgust as they passed each other. Everyone else in the city seemed quite disgusted and pained to walk around creatures such as themselves.
But this story is not entirely about random disgusting people walking on Green Street. This is a story passing Green Street to the narrow street of Frederick, then turning right into Derick Avenue near a rather large oak tree. There stood several small apartments compressed in concrete, it had only ten floors, quite miniature compared to the surrounding tall buildings. 
On this particular night the sounds of traffic echoed through the street, bright coloured vehicles stopped and others moved at the traffic lights, they took turns, eagerly waiting for the light to change to green. 
As they waited for the bright green light something fell from the stars. It looked rather like a human body. A human body floating like a feather in the dark sky. The stars twinkled as if they had sent a gift down to Earth.
And so he fell.
He was not surprised, even though his dark eyes were wide open. It was probably the wind, he thought to himself. His father had silently applied his hand towards his chest before his fall, the hand had enough force to make his legs unsteady and knock him off balance. His body moved back involuntarily at the power of the hand. The last item he had seen was the edge of his father’s black robe, and then the pulling force took over.
He fell.
His body stilled and tensed and his heart followed tune, it did not race nor did it beat. He was dead of course, though technically he had never really lived or died to be called dead, but his features resembled a dead person. 
His face was slightly bluish pale, his hair dark as sin. His crimson eyes stared into the blackness of space as his body continued to drop, it moved further from the glistening stars, moving down, down nearer to the ground and then he felt the atmosphere change, everything he knew was beginning to change, but was that not how one grows?
He placed his hands firmly in the warmth of his pockets as he fell, thinking of the importance of change. He inhaled the whooshing wind and noted that everything smelled different, it smelled of rain, soil, and something odd. Whatever the smell was, he did not like it. He felt the current of the wind on his face and heard only the whoosh sound as he dropped.
Tiny fragments appeared in the night air. 
Rain, he thought. 
He saw the raindrops linger in the atmosphere, passing his skin, and felt them wet his clothes and face. His hands remained in his pockets as gravity pulled his body with violent force towards the ground. He found himself rapidly passing the top of a large oak tree, the leaves and branches scraped his skin, ripping some of his clothes.
Yet, he could not feel much as he fell, there was something appealing about not having a heart and not sensing pain. His crimson eyes never blinked, they remained wide as the wind passed through, he just stared at the stars winking at him in delight.
Then the rainy droplets fell into his open eyes, and still he did not blink, they kept weeping on his skin. 
“Rain.” He whispered to the night. As he felt the droplets on his face, green leaves tumbled in with the rapid droplets, he cocked his head slightly, analysing the peculiar motion. It resembled a rather green storm, even though the night hid the green colour, he still noticed it, the way the greenness of the leaves had different shades of green, that was British Racing Green shade beneath the leaf, he noted. And that was Celadon that represented the top shade of the leaf and the venation of the leaf colour was Chartreuse. 
He quickly closed his eyes, pushing away the shaded green leaf colours. It was always like this with everything. Even though he detested the colour green, his unfortunate brain would keep a record of the most pointless things. But this event was a rare occasion, his unfortunate brain reminded him, it was not every day that one experienced a mix of droplets and leaves, yet still within him, he hated the colour because of its representation of life and for once he was glad he was the one authorised to take it away.
One British Racing Green, Celadon and Chartreuse leaf stuck to his forehead not willing to leave and follow the rest of its fellow green compadres to the ground. It stuck firmly to his skin and he could not help but squint his eyes, staring at it in bother. The close proximity of the leaf made him realise that the leaf had more shades of green than his brain had described, thus his brain updated the information, there were actually 19 shades of green on this leaf. He quickly shut his eyes again, trying to retrieve the silent darkness but his unfortunate brain plastered the shades of green into view with labels attached, Asparagus, Lime Green, Myrtle, British Racing Green, Jade, Pear, Spring Green, Tea Green, Celadon, Moss Green, Chartreuse, Olive, Harlequin, Shamrock Green, Sea Green... “STOP!” He huffed out and his unfortunate brain quietened down as he hit the ground, the ground pounded, it slightly vibrated against the impact of his body. He was thankful for the vibration for it silenced his unfortunate brain, he remained on the muddy dark soil for a few minutes with his eyes tightly closed, his hands were still in his pockets and the glistening dew drops continued to drench his clothes. His eyes opened and he stared into the stars. He was not surprised that his brain began to identify the brilliance of each individual star in the night’s sky but what really surprised him was that the varied green shaded leaf managed to fuse to his forehead and his unfortunate brain, which he was currently deeming fortunate, had actually failed to identify the rest of the green shades of this particular leaf.

Her chestnut hair was tied in a strong bun. Her face remained still in complete concentration, staring at the books in front of her, her round glasses reflected the equation on the page. Her whole body was barely seated on the wooden chair as she sat glued in excitement at the discovery of the mathematical solution. She tapped her pen on the paper, the ink flowed as she found the product of the vector to solve the simple geometric problem.
She enjoyed numbers from birth. Nurse Mathews had told her the first word that fell from her mouth was a number. When she learned to hold a crayon she drew numerals and giggled as she added arms to the numbers. Nurse Mathews had been so shocked, no two year old should be able to understand numbers; Nurse Mathews despised numbers, due to the lack of zeros attached to her pay cheque. 
Yet Emma Dove enjoyed numbers immensely, her childhood hobby of mathematical numerals had remained with her until her adulthood.
She was twenty-two and a second year student at Raines University doing her major in Pure Mathematics. She enjoyed numbers, linear equations and finding product vectors. Numbers were alive to her, she could see them hidden in sculptures, paintings, humans and even spilt milk. There were always numbers in messes, complex equations that needed the tangent or root to be found.
In everything she saw she noticed a pattern, a pattern of calculating numbers. She would enjoy finding an answer that could mean so much more than an average ‘mean’ number, or that the answer was an average number. Everything in the world was based on a number, the angles, the degrees, ages, years. Even Pythagoras agreed with her, everything is a number.
The glow from her room was the sole light in the whole apartment building, it was dark outside and the rain spattered violently against her window, yet she failed to notice as she continued, lost in the world of concentrated numbers. 
Her eyes never wavered until she heard the sound. It was a rustle, a rumbling of fallen branches, and finally a loud thump. Even through the chaos of the thunderous rain the sound was audible. Her eyes widened, wondering what lurked beyond her window, was someone watching her and then accidentally fallen out of the tree? Was it a thief? Her mind began to automatically find the statistical percentage of reason and she calmed down as her calculations told her it was a lonely stray cat, afraid of the lightning, it fell out of the tree, broke a few branches and landed on its four clawed paws.
She nodded her head in agreement picking up her Third Edition of Calculus 3, considered throwing it out the window at the culprit, but she decided against it, she would not throw such an important book at a cat. She stood from her chair and bravely approached her window, to find if the statistical probability was indeed correct. 
Taking a large gulp of air and slowly drawing the curtain she whispered,
“It’s that evil cat, it’s that evil cat.”
As she peeked through her window, adjusting the curtain to have a full view of the transparent wet glass, she saw him. He was right in front of her window. Staring back at her with his devilish eyes, his hair a drenched mess. But she did not notice that his eyes glowed dangerously, almost near the colour of liquid blood, he had no irises just a splat of overflowing red within his eye ball, instead she observed the shape of his face, slightly circular, and her mind began to calculate. First she went into geometric mode, identifying the maximum area for the least perimeter, the most symmetrical area of his circular face and lastly the tangent and radius perpendicular, then her brain quickly switched to analytic mode where the parameterized equation began to form and the equidistant points were transferred to numbers. She began to see the numbers and the ‘x’, ‘y’ and ‘r’ were being solved, added ‘cos’ and ‘tan’ to the equation and there she saw the number, a perfect 8.
She grinned, “An 8, a perfect 8.”
His circular face looked like a big 8, he had no eyes for the moment, no real shape just a head that resembled an 8.

***

Ner Relc Alcott rose to his feet, grasping at the variably shaded green leaf on his head. His clothes were ruined by the fall and soaked by the rain. He was used to the rain, the rain was a constant gloom in his home and that suited his mood just fine. He held the leaf and stared at it in the rainy moonlight, his fortunate brain had not described anything, it was rather quiet. He held the leaf in his hands, zooming it closer and then further from his eyes. He waited for his brain to categorise but nothing happened. It was all silence. There was no echoes of Harlequin, Shamrock Green, Sea Green, or anything related to green. “Brilliant!” Ner exclaimed, his brain had finally realised his feelings or what you could deem ‘feelings’ to someone who never lived. His brain now knew that Ner, its master, hated the colour green, that the greenness of it made him squirm, that it was the whole concept of life. Just thinking of the colour automatically made him crush the leaf within his palm, sending the crumbled damp pieces to the ground.
He took in his surroundings and immediately recognised that this was Earth. The tiny planet that no one ever talked about and the place most of the undead vacationed to, eager to reset their lives. The planet that was rather insignificant, plain and filled with living human specimens. It was filled with blues and greens instead of the usual blacks and greys of the entire universe.
He combed his fingers through his hair, removing the brown and green filth, then dusted the grimy mud from his clothes, uncertain why exactly his father had forced him to fall instead of instantly sending him through time and space. He looked around the area and noticed a concrete building staring at him, the paint on the walls was fading, revealing a few patches of grey concrete. His brain briefly decided to provide him with information on shades of grey, and it opened to him the history of the entire building. “Very useful.” Ner said.
He found the encouraging glow from a curtained window and his brain decided the light was inviting so he leapt up and hovered near the window, surprisingly the girl inside had closed the yellow curtain even before he had knocked. He stared at her, trying his best not to look grim, yet she saw him, her glasses reflecting his image through her eyes. Her eyes revealed no shock or fear, they just stared as if she was dissecting an unnatural insect. Well, he was unnatural, he had no heart, had no pulse, he had bluish pale skin that many would consider a dead corpse, yet still people would not be so rude as to scrutinise his features, as if trying to discover if he had a soul.
After five minutes of her scrutinising stare, she began to shout in wheezy content.
“An Eight, you are a number 8, my friend. Hah!” She pointed her finger at his face as the rain continued to fall.
A number eight and a friend? Perhaps she recognized him as one of her friends? This was very unexpected. He could play Mr Eight, but how would that aid him? It would not, he decided. At least from the words she had spoken, he somewhat resembled human beings from Earth, thus the requirements for him to blend in for this Section 3.4.3.1 mission would be easy. It would assist in accomplishing his duty faster.

***

Ner had been to Earth only once before, his father had allowed him to assist in delivering a parcel for the deadly business. His father never spoke, he just, ‘Hmmed’ and ‘Ahhed.’ Even when he was demonstrating the methods and procedures of the deadly business he would ‘Hmm’ with action and ‘Ahh’ when he was over with the illustration.
That was his father, one of the leaders of the Council who followed, rather than led, but he never minded. His father hated the long working hours, extra hours and the overtime hours. It was all hours and houred ticks and houred clocks, never once was he given an overtime second, it had to be hours, hours and more hours. He had forgotten his own voice in the midst of the long hours, he had forgotten the time of his own world when he stared at all the Clocks in his office, the hours passing in grim humour.
The millions of Clocks in his office were from different worlds, they were made of dried crushed bones, the minute hands were bony index fingers and the second hands were short, plump bony thumbs. But they would all stare at him, laughing as they hourly rang for him to hurry to his feet leaving his tea awfully cold. He could have sat down and enjoyed his tea yet he always felt obligated, he was paranoid that his other duplicated selves would muck up the creativity he had put in most of the obituaries he wrote. So he would never know the tea was cold because when he returned someone would have drunk it, it was his son, Ner.
Ner often went to see his father and his room of universal Clocks, he had never found his father, just an awful hand-written note, alerting Ner that he would arrive soon. So Ner would wait and sit in the big black leather chair, enjoying the sight of the Clocks in the gloomy grey wallpapered room. He would eventually find a decent book to read and be lost in discovering more knowledge in the words while drinking bland, cold tea.
His father was determined to teach him everything that was possible about this dark, deadly business before he retired. His father was tired of ash, of dead souls, of creative stories that were never really read and of hours linked to hours on overtop hours. His words were never appreciated even when he had a voice and even more so for his current scribbled notes. At least his son appreciated his effort, he had personally concluded that his son, Ner Relc Alcott, would succeed him. Everyone enjoyed his raspy voice, his sense of no humour, his slender yet muscular frame, they thought he paid too much attention to detail, he was too serious and arrogant for all the worlds combined which made him the perfect candidate. Thus, the Council Members always considered Ner the solution to all their problems in the universe.
"Send him, Send him," they would chant or grumble in song when the violent flash of red would siren within their walls indicating an irregular management problem. They did not know the problem, were too lazy to read the cluttering, clammy documents and the small font, plus millions of words needed bright light and they detested light.
They would force Miss Underwood to read aloud the problems of mismanagement, she would stand straight with a flash light in one hand focusing the light on the 3 000 page document and begin. She would never get far because she would stutter the words. The furthest she had gotten was page two, which was the ‘Table of Contents.’
Miss Underwood could write very proficiently, she was the Council’s secretary, every little minor detail that did not have to be said she could manage perfectly. Words were her favourite hobby, it was her life, yet she could never fluently express them in voice, they would come out a stuttering stutter and some Council members had speculated she had gotten the silent disease, the symptoms were stuttering, then an awkward silence and an embarrassed red face, which Miss Underwood always had when she spoke. They considered her silent disease being linked to the Fifth Council Member's disease of silence but they never really thought about it, thus they would always send her away irritated, and decide to sing in union about sending Ner.

***

Ner stared at the young lady, this odd creature who pointed her finger at his face, laughing about a number 8. Her hair was tied up in a ball, and brown strands of hair fell out, shaping the outline of her face. Her face was oval and her nose small, yet her eyes were surrounded by enormous round, red-brimmed spectacles, it was a surprise that he had seen her eyes despite her spectacle lenses being so foggy and misty. He noticed a bit of green and brown in her eyes, yet he could not be quite certain. How odd that his brain was uncertain, he thought to himself.
He managed to open the window, holding the sliding glass above his head as he entered her room. His black, dripping shoe reached the carpet and he stood, his hands in his pockets, staring at the objects in her room. Her desk was in the far corner of her small square-spaced home, her bed in the opposite corner, squashed against the wall. But as he noted the objects of her room he noticed that everything had a sticky note with a number on it. The desk had a number 12, the bed had a number 16, the chair had a number 7 and a half. He saw the millions of different shades of paper with random numbers that he could not make sense of. This was the second time his brain was uncertain, he turned his head away from the numbers, deciding it was best to ignore the numbers and stared directly at the young lady. She had stopped laughing and just gazed at him. Her expression quite unclear, but her brown eyebrows had lifted up.
“Ah.” He began, his voice a raspy syllable.
Annoyed with himself for using, 'Ah' since it was his father’s habit that was now kicking into him. He had heard it too often from his father’s lips that his brain could not ignore it but keep it stored somewhere, and when he least expected it, his voice would form the syllable.
"I am Ner Relc Alcott," He said, ignoring his previous word to her.
She stood staring at him after watching him move his body through her window. Her carpet was a big puddle where he stood. His number eight head began to talk, she stared amazed. 
She could not really hear what he said because she was concentrating on finding another mathematical pattern for the symmetry of his body. She could not help it, she needed to make a number of everything she saw to be comfortable with anything. Once everything had been converted to a number her mind would relax and everything would be in perfect order.
Ner wondered why she would not respond to his statement. Many people would be afraid of his presence. He wore an ancient, black, single-breasted suit, with a notched lapel, and three silver buttons on each cuff. The shadowy colour of his suit matched his breeches. He had no tie, just a plain white shirt. The expensive pitch black suit made his features graver, as if he was going to a serious life and death business meeting, where he usually did go. His victims’ faces would turn ghastly in his presence, when he mentioned his name they would faint, their eyes would grow huge, and their hearts would stop.
And that is what he desired, their hearts to stop.
They knew that once Ner Relc Alcott was here, it meant their days were over, they would be dead soon. No more sunshine, no rain, no more breath, no more anything. 
Ner had the authority to take the souls of people, to ensure they were dead. He had learned from his father through his 'Ahhs' and 'Hmms' how the procedure went and was given the thick textbook manual prior to the practical. The manual began with the facts of the entire universe.
Fact One: The Clock represents life, all of the universe of possible living beings.
Fact Two: Death is linked to the lives of the living through the Clock and miniature Clocks.
Fact Three: Death is able to transmit himself simultaneously to any living being.
His father had constantly mentioned that they were of great importance, in his awful handwriting. 
His father would write,‘IMPORTANT,’ and eye Ner critically with his shadowed face. Ner would quickly change from his bored gaze to a choke when he caught a glimpse of his father’s eyes through the darkness of his face, it was a mix of silver and scarlet, it was one of those parent looks forcing you to be obedient. The training went well, quick and proficient as expected of Ner. Ner discovered a determination within him to honour his father’s name and eventually his memory, when of course he was ready to retire, so his attitude moved from passive to eager. Paging keenly to his favourite page he continued to read the manual of the first procedure of dying.
Death’s Employment Description
Procedure One
There will be multiple accurate perceived clocked deaths. Death must simultaneously meet with all living beings that are prompted to die at the given clocked second.
Ner read the manual with interest, he enjoyed reading and discovering how anything actually worked. There was nothing like being absorbed in researching a life, yet before Ner could reach the theory of the second procedure Ner’s father had illustrated it to him. Ner had been on the last word of the first procedure, when his father had quickly placed his notepad in front of Ner’s face, his father had written ‘STOP!!!’ so Ner had stopped obediently and his father led him to his first experience of death, or rather witnessing a death, or witnessing a predicted clocked death.
His father had transported them to the planet Gore, Ner had seen the victim, in frightening awe, the colour of his skin was musty and his terrified sweat added to the mustiness. His father did not say anything to the victim, he just casually walked to the frightened being while Ner curiously observed from a  distance. 
His father touched the victim’s chest and extracted the piece of the soul, that was the Spark, the ignition of life, a bright swirling energy. A vial suddenly emerged from the atmosphere and his father took the Spark and placed it in the vial. As soon as the blazing white energy entered the vial, it turned to greyish ash. A number appeared with the victim’s name on the vial. Categorising the dead in numbers and names - this was his father’s job.
His father was Death and Ner was Death’s Son.
The victim would die soon after the meeting. Death met his victims before they died. They died exactly five minutes after their Spark of life was taken. The Clock and the universal Clocks were a necessity to balance the nature of life, they would alert Death that a possible demise would occur in the surrounding worlds. He would remove their Spark,  and at times write their creative deaths, he would pen their decent final minutes rather than leave it to their free will, which was usually a heart attack or something natural that the Council had intended, but to Death that was not fun. He enjoyed this part immensely, he had become accustomed to writing and the creativity that went with it. He usually penned creative thoughts, he made people desire to travel to icy areas so that he could write that they froze to death due to their passionate desire for the frost, and then they would shatter into a billion pieces. Another game he enjoyed was making people dig a hole and then bury themselves.
Death had a mind for creativity, living since the beginning of the Clock, yet even though he had the creative flow, he detested the snapping of his fingers to reach his victim, rushing to foreign worlds and removing the souls of random people. He hated the rules, the order. The five minutes of his creativity ended up in a vial, with a number. He needed more time to write, he wanted liberty. There always had to be order in the deceased business, it made him tired and paranoid.
When this procedure occurred, time would stand still and only he and the victim would move, the victim would grieve, spurt words of confusion, grief and love. The movement through time and worlds tired him. 
The employment of the dark passenger was taking its toll on him. He desired to retire, be free, left alone to rest with his creative ideas. Maybe start a book or begin a newspaper. He even thought of titles for the newspaper. The Daily Retired Death Chronicles, Death to Die Times, Retired Death Times, there were too many names he had thought of. He was old and tired of being Death but his son was young, cold, arrogant, knowledgeable, he absorbed concepts and strategies like a sponge, and he liked to read and understand why things were the way they were. What was more interesting about his son was that he enjoyed removing the Spark of the soul from the living. There was a glow and blaze in the eyes that portrayed the glint of happiness in his son’s eyes as the Spark left a being's body, leaving them looking like dolls or puppets. Indeed, his son would make the perfect Death.

***

Ner had received the Gold Pocket Watch of Earth before his fall. It was attached to the inside of his trouser pocket by a chain; this Clock linked him to all living beings on Earth. He could tap his pinkie with his thumb or the Golden Watch and the name of any person on Earth could be identified. He had come to Earth to find four beings, the four beings that were known as the undead. According to Section 3.4.3.1, these undead creatures had corrupted the balance of the natural system. The problem was that Death could not be linked to the undead, he was only linked to the soul Spark of the living. He could find everyone who was alive and breathing and about to die, but not the dead.
Those who were dead and now had risen using unscrupulous methods to extend their lives, were tainted. They would kill beings, causing the Clocks to over-clock, and this caused instability in the universe. Their souls, now tainted, could not be connected to Death, even though they roamed the streets of Earth. They were dead to Death, they were meant to be vials with sticky labelled names written on them, until the proposed time where their Sparks would forget their existence, their memories, and their lives and reset themselves into a new Spark.
These new Sparks would develop in form during the birth of a child. It was all a cycle, a balanced cycle. This cycle did not have time for undead beings who resented being dead and wished to extend their immortality. This was not as the world or the Councils had authorised, these undead beings needed to be dealt with.
The undead would feed on the soul Sparks of other living beings, removing their Sparks, and the loss of Sparks meant a loss of birth, which left an unbalanced spectrum of energy. It was discovered a week ago, at a Council Meeting which Ner was not allowed to attend. The documents reporting the loss of Sparks lay open in the centre of the table. His father sat across from them, aimlessly staring at them. Ner approached his father and his father had scribbled, Section 3.4.3.1 with his finger on the table then pointed to the hefty documents.
Every hundred years there would be an audit of each Council member, and if there was an error it needed to be resolved. 
The whole universe depended on the Councils who now depended on Ner Relc Alcott. Ner would solve the problem of this unbalanced nature, he would assist his father, he would find the first undead being, the horrid Vampire, but he needed humanity’s help for this.
There was a reason why he fell in this place, near the dirt of an oak tree, near a building with a sole light shining. He needed her and her strange numbers to help him.


Chapter 2
‘One true slave is a dozen better than a hundred friends’

"Ah," he said, surprised that he had used ‘ah’ again. He uttered it because of the lack of expression from this human.
She had finished her equations on him and was laughing, raindrops falling from her wet hair. She discovered he was a sum of 13. The total number of all his body parts added to a measly 13. She did not like the number 13 much.
13 Had many misfortunes attached, it was Nurse Mathews who continually mentioned this. The nurse who had looked after her since she was baby was always superstitious about love, bad luck, and generally about life. Emma was fond of numbers, so Nurse Mathews lived in paranoia about the numbers Emma discovered everywhere. She imposed many of her theories onto Emma and Emma believed quite a few. It was the numbers that kept her grounded, and the comforting words of Nurse Mathews when Emma felt lonely or stressed. The comforting words displaced the paranoid theories and were genuine love for her daughter, Emma Dove.
Emma had been left alone in the hospital after her biological mother had given birth to her. Her mother died immediately afterwards. 
The blood would not stop, Nurse Mathews told her, and she had tried her best, listening to the doctor's instructions, applying pressure, yet the sheets kept soaking red. The doctor finally stated the time of death and at once Emma was alone in the world.
On that day Nurse Mathews saw Emma in the tiny isolette, moving her small arms and legs, her innocent green eyes staring back at Nurse Mathews in curiosity. She giggled brightly. That was the moment when Nurse Mathews made a decision, she would adopt Emma as her own and love her with all her heart and strength. And she did, Emma was raised with the gift of numbers and love of the Mathews.
Nurse Mathews' only other living relative was her father, who visited both of them when Emma was in her kindergarten and high school years.  Now that Emma was an adult she had moved to a different part of the city, quite far from where her mother and grandfather lived. Thus Nurse Mathews and her father tried their best to visit Emma every Tuesday to ensure that Emma was doing well. They loved her and even loved her obsession with numbers.

***

Emma scratched her head as the big number 13 faded into a mist, revealing the dark person beneath it. She stared at him, frightened by his appearance, pale blue and his eyes glowed red. He kept blinking, waiting for something. He wore a dark suit with miniature horizontal rips, as if razors had made small cuts on the sides of his clothes.
His hair was a ruffled black, his aristocratic features betrayed an arrogance that hung in the air where he stood, as if the air acknowledged him as a being of grand importance. He looked like he was from somewhere cold, her grandfather always said 'the paler they are the colder they’re from'. So he must be from an icy foreign land. There were many, many odd people on Earth.
“Ah, yes,” she said. She used ‘ah’ often to hide her nervousness and to hide that she did not know what to say.
He stared at her, his crimson eyes grew smaller, his hands never seemed to leave his pockets.
She used the ‘Ah’ word, was she mocking him? He shrugged it off, it was the first word she mentioned to him since she had pointed 8 and then 13 at his face. She must have snapped out of her numbering, pointing world and was now coherent, so he attempted to speak again, trying his level best to tone his voice into being less raspy.
“My name is Ner Relc Alcott. I am sure you have heard of me.” He heard himself say the words, they were not cheerful. But he was in the dreadful business and his father was Death, how could the Son of Death be cheerful, or even attempt a voice that was less raspy?
She felt a chill in the atmosphere that seemed to ooze from the stranger in her room. She knew it was not from the rain, but to keep calm her logic assumed it was. She moved one hand to her chin, glancing up at the ceiling as if she was attempting to retrieve a lost memory or a name.
She repeated his name.
“Ner Relc Alcott, Ner Relc Alcott, Ner…” She stopped looking up and stared at him. She lifted both her arms toward the ceiling in victory and smiled brightly.
"Ned Reese Allen." She said happily, she knew the name was familiar, she had read it in the newspaper. He was a famous painter in the city. His exhibition was in four days, he usually painted abstract and people ‘ooohed’ and ‘ahhhed’ over his beautiful artworks. She would be going with her grandfather, her grandfather enjoyed art. When she asked him about this hobby, he replied that the abstract artworks made him think there was indeed a greater force out there, there were hidden signals within abstract paintings.
“No.” Ner kept blinking rapidly, trying to understand why she did not know him. He was slightly annoyed about this. He stroked his forehead while he thought of the best response for this particular human.
“It’s Ner Relc Alcott.” He used his best grim voice that came quite naturally. He moved his hand from his head and tapped the Golden Watch in his pocket. As the sound clicked, her name popped into the air right above her, along with all her identification in a glowing black font. 
Emma Dove, twenty two, green eyes, adopted, majoring in Pure Mathematics…
“Ner Relc Alcott.” She frowned, disappointed she had gotten his identity wrong. She looked up to the ceiling again, trying to wait for the answer to drop on her head and while she stared above for guidance she tapped her finger on her chin.
All she could think of was Ned. Ned the painter. Ned the artist that her grandfather was excited to see. She dropped her hands in defeat, slouching her shoulders.
“Just who are you?”
“I am the Son of Death,” he said, irritated that he was unknown to her, and then wondering how he could be irritated for he was born without any emotion. 
“The son of death?” She asked, her glasses almost falling off.  She quickly reached up to keep them in position.
She recalled the stories Nurse Mathews told her of Death. Yet, she never knew Death would have a son. 
Emma believed in the supernatural because of her mother, yet even in mathematics the numbers and equations have patterns of supernatural, so it was not entirely science and facts.
She enjoyed the stories of vampires, werewolves and fables of talking pigs and grim monsters. She always found a numerical pattern in them and made Nurse Mathews laugh. But this was different, this person who stood before her was the Son of Death, he was real, not a figment of her imagination or was he? He was a stranger in her room. Was he here to kill her?
Death usually meant he came for you to bargain or plead for your life, then he would laugh and take it anyway, she knew of how Death worked, she had watched the movies of Death with her mother. And she even agreed with Death to take those people's lives, but this was not a horror movie, this was her life. 
Emma was oblivious to dangerous situations, she would see numbers before she could really understand the reality of the situation. The reality of her situation was that this person in her room was the Son of Death and he was going to kill her. She gulped and her body shivered involuntarily.
He stared at her, enjoying the fear she oozed. 
Finally, he thought, the response of fear he was used to. He could fall back into the routine with him as dark lord and she as the scared victim interested in doing his bidding. But she was not a victim, he thought. She was meant to be his helper, or was it servant? Why could his unfortunate brain not remember this important point? It must have been because his father had written the point down on a notepad and his handwriting was so bad it needed a cryptographer. Not even the best part of Ner's brain could figure out his written words, even though Ner could read, speak and understand all the 6 500 languages spoken on Earth alone.
“Are yyyouuu goooinng to kkkiill me?” 
“I will. It is what I was created to do." He said slowly, "But there is an opportunity for you to prolong your life, if you assist me on Earth.” He moved his face closer.
She saw his eyes were balls of flames, endlessly burning and rotating. 
His pale blue face seemed rather cold and his expression was of pitch black seriousness. Her mind went blank as she saw the calculations of numbers, attempting to find the solution towards the burning flames of his eyes. Her expression changed from fear to concentrated scrutiny.
He watched as her fear faded and that rude look appeared.
He wore a deep frown, and he swore he could see a mathematical equation floating through her lenses. This was not expected, he had not expected his servant to be one who could change moods often and would offend him without knowing. He heard the slight tick of a ring in the air. It meant someone on Earth had to die. He actually heard a number of rings in the air, the ticking clocks.
He had taken the Earth deaths when he had taken the Golden Pocket Watch. He would always follow through on duty and obligation no matter the circumstance for this is what he was created for, so he snapped his fingers, pausing time to his will and split himself. It was an easy trick. 
Death taught him the third rule of the deceased business, one needed to be accurate to the tick of the Clock, every second counted in the lifespan of a being’s death.
You needed to have the will to be almost ahead of time, too soon and the abrupt death would be wasted, too late and the passing second had consequences. But it was impossible to be too early or late, as time would stop at his will, but there was a reason for this rule, so Ner never took it lightly. 
He saw his other selves begin to multiply and vanish through the space of time. This was one of the advantages of being Death’s Son - the ability to be in the space between a dying victim and a living person.
He wondered if he should stay and watch Miss Emma Dove during the death procedure, for his other selves would manage perfectly fine without him, or maybe he could read the book on humanity his father lent him. It could assist him to find some meaningful clue as to her mannerism, yet he decided otherwise and snapped his fingers to the first victim.
Time slowed, stopped, and paused. Everything stopped. 
He saw blue and yellow bright lights before his instant transfer in space and time. And then he was in the middle of the jungle. The greenness of it all made him rather sick, so he concentrated on his victim. It was a man with blue eyes staring at him in fear.
The procedure had began, the man that eyed Ner could not run or take a step back or forwards, he stood panic-stricken, unable to move, immobilised with fear and death. This would be his final horror position. 
Across from the man New saw people huddled around a small camp-fire, their tents already pitched up inviting them to sleep.
The Son of Death walked towards the man, tears forming in his blue eyes. He wore a red hefty jacket, blue jeans, and  plastic boots. He remained still as he cried out for help. Ner finally reached the man. He knew that if you approach a victim they wer more frightened and easier to deal with. The man’s screams of help stopped when he saw no one could hear him. He tried to move but an invisible force field held him in place.
“I am Ner Relc Alcott.” Ner always used this introduction to alert someone to the possibility of their death, “Son of Death.” 
“Please, please, no, no don’t kill me.” The man whispered in shock.
Ner did not need to tap on the Golden Pocket Watch in these occasions, he had prepared it. He read the man’s identity from the air.
His name was Christian Lee Evans, his worked as a real estate agent, he was forty three years of age. Ner scrolled down, glossing over the man's bad and good deeds.
Christian’s only good act was that he had a child named Charlotte Evans. His terrible deeds filled at least five hundred pages, One bad deed was laughing at Stewart Bagster when he lost his job and his home.
“The Clock demands it is your time, Christian Lee Evans,” Ner said, emotionless. He liked using full names, that way he would see their eyes widen to their full extent and know everything Ner said was the truth.
He knew that the Spark of the soul was stored in vials, but during the process of a reboot in the Spark, the Councillors judged that the dependence on your good and terrible deeds would bring the judgement process of purification and reset the Spark soul. He never knew the exact details of the purification process, just that it needed to be done, yet Ner was very curious what it meant.
Christian fell to his knees and whimpered. He gripped his thinning, white hair.
“No, no, this cannot be.”
“By the Clock it is,” Ner said, applying his palm to the chest of Christian. He slowly removed his hand and a bright white energy surrounded by a scarlet light appeared, drawn from Christian’s chest.
Bright energy orbited around the white ball in three curved horizontal lines. A vial appeared in the transparent air and found the empty hand of Ner. He moved the white energy, first moulding it into a finer, smaller liquid form, placing it into the glass vial. As soon as it entered, it turned to ash.
Ner closed the vial and when he let it go the atmosphere claimed it, lifting it towards the night sky before it vanished. 
Christian's eyes dulled, his heart stopped, his body had lost his soul. He had no more breath, he had lost his only Spark. 
A book appeared from Christian's body, it protruded from his chest making his body the podium holder for the book.
The book glowed white and Ner knew he could write a creative death for the minutes Christian was to live or perhaps he could just write ‘END’ with his finger, because he did have more important matters to deal with. He lifted his finger and wrote,
In the last minute of his life he will clutch his chest, his heart will stop beating, regretful tears will rise to his eyes and his soul will fade and his body will remain. End.
And so Ner wrote even though he had more important matters, he thought that every human should regret their terrible deeds that they did on this Earth and in their life, but it was not as if he really cared. He was created to take lives, not to be sympathetic or philosophical about them. It was his brain that was always curious, categorising and always constantly analysing, the only time his brain allowed him to rest was when he read a book. 
"Done." Ner said, as he glanced over his final word in the life of Christian Lee Evans. He always had to conclude the story with End. It seemed to be a closing of one’s life that could not be changed. Ner closed the book and read the title. 

THE LIFE AND DEATH OF CHRISTIAN LEE EVANS.

 He sighed and opened the Pocket Watch. It revealed he had one death left to do, the other him was taking his time, well not really, he knew his other selves were always prompt. He snapped his fingers, entered his other self and instantly found himself writing another dull obituary.

***

Ner Relc Alcott had finished with the Earth’s deaths for the day. He snapped his fingers between the spaces of time and found himself near Miss Emma Dove. She was in the midst of scrutinising his features, so he remained in his previous position, staring at her. 
Time began to tick and Emma’s nose twitched as she analysed Ner, deep in concentration. He blinked, seeing how close she was to him and tried to move away from her. 
He’d rather wait for her to say something for she was a strange one, with her odd staring and horrendous pointing. He was about to move away when she grabbed his shoulders roughly and firmly.
"Stay still," she said in an almost dangerous low tone. She had not finished calculating the flaming eyes, the shape was different so she had to draw lines within the flames in order to gain a prominent shape. She was carrying on happily when she saw the blue of his eye. Right in the centre there was something glowing blue. It resembled St Elmo’s fire, the blue, violet burn. But it was growing within his eye, the blue flame was absorbing the normal orange- red flames, then it solidified and turned black with a blue centre like a normal eye.
Ner never once blinked during the entire process. He stood firmly as she suggested and she kept drawing her face closer to his, which felt slightly uncomfortable. He had not been this close to another being and no other being had ever decided to grab him as she did. This was feeling too uncomfortable, he broke free from her grasp. He turned to the window, seeing the rising sun in the reflection. His eyes would change from scarlet red to blackish blue at sunrise.
"You have weird eyes," she said, confused at the transformation of his eyes.
His face found hers and he said.
"I am Death’s Son." His voice solemn.
"Is that your explanation?" She asked, staring into his curious eyes.
"You are strange," he said, ignoring her question.
Silence filled the room. Emma felt offended by his words, people had called her weird or strange a million times in kindergarten. In high school it got worse, teenagers had a larger and more vulgar vocabulary, and even the nerds said she was too weird for them. They said she was on another level of nerdiness. Her mother encouraged her to fit in and she tried, but she could not. She cried on her pillow most nights of high school, wishing for the years to pass. Eventually they did. 
She was now in university, heaven compared to the torture and torment of high school. Strange was an ability people never understood, her Grandfather always said.
"Strange, is a cherished ability that you don’t understand," She blurted, filling the awkward silence. Her face turned red with embarrassment.
He stared at her coolly, his expression unchanged by her outburst. He put his hand in his pockets, his clothes now dried and repaired. Travelling through space and time had mended his clothing to brand new. During the stoppage of time, whilst in the process of removing Sparks from the living, Ner would always think of strategies, the appropriate lists of the pros and cons of a situation. It always depended on the pros and cons of lists. He had drawn millions of solutions to countless problems that the Council had approached him with. Ner, like a perfect manual, defined the problem, assessed the advantages and disadvantages, and then gave the best possible outcome to the Council. 
His emotions seldom surfaced, only feeling something when he took life. It filled him with grim joy, the life lost from someone’s eyes. It was a fulfilment that only Death could understand. Yet, he thought about Miss Emma Dove’s definition of the word ‘strange’.
If strangeness was a talent, it was a unique talent. Every strange idea always ended being brilliant. He wondered about this strange creature before him, she was meant to be his servant for a purpose, she needed to have strange talent in order to assist him. It was the logical conclusion. His father always constructed a reason for every interaction, even though he seemed rather scatter-brained in recent months. His father had a certain look, the deep in thought look, one that would keep you hours from the realities of duty and obligation. His father's usual grim ‘Ahh's’ and ‘Hmm's’ seemed less instructive, less of everything that it usually was. He knew his father was tired and stressed over the lack of creativity in the business, yet it was still duty to the Council. Everything he knew was for the Council, He could not let his father fail. He needed to solve this Section 3.4.3.1.
He stared at Emma Dove.
"Miss Emma Dove," He said her name slowly, "You will assist me to find a Vampire." He continued his voice lingering on each word intentionally, ensuring she had heard every word.
There was rather something arrogant in the way he said that sentence as if she had no option to refuse. Find a Vampire, he had said. 
"A Vampire? They do not exist." She said.
"They should not. Unfortunately, they do. They are rotting corpses, devouring innocent souls. Their hearts are old, every pore dehydrated and I believe they have an arid stench about them," Ner said, recalling the book Miss Underwood had given him. He said this with absolute seriousness, and when Ner Relc Alcott said words in seriousness they were true as death.
She stared at him, he looked gloomy, dark and serious. He was the Son of Death, could she even believe that he was? Her statistical calculations proved all accounts of his identity false, there was a less than one percent chance, a very small, insignificant, 0.01 percent chance that he claimed who he said he was, was correct. She would need proof, not that the flaming eyeballs were not proof enough. So she gulped all the air she could muster, and with a confident air she breathed in.
"I need proof you are the Son of Death!" She exclaimed, an eyebrow twitching nervously. This man who claimed to be the Son of Death did not bat an eyelash. He stared at her, expressionless, his hands still in his pockets. 
"Hmm, proof." He kept his eyes on her, even though he was annoyed that he had used one of his father's words: Hmm. In many situations particularly the ones on Earth he had noticed he was using them often, in a matter of hours. She wanted proof, this pesky human creature wanted proof that he was the Son of Death, never mind that he walked in gloom and darkness, and his black suit had a gleam and sheen of shadow on it, and his eyes were very haunting and unusual. She still wanted proof. So he lifted one hand from his pocket and began to demonstrate the proof she so fondly needed.
His pale blue hand began to glow, his fingertips contained a swirling white energy, the middle finger shone with black light, a black, horrid fire that made Emma's heart fearful. She held her breath as she stared the frightening black fire, she saw no numbers, just the black fire. It began to ignite the white glow on his other fingertips. Her heart beat rapidly and her panicked eyes immediately moved to his face but instead of his face. She saw the colour of his black suit rise from the material, it gave rise to a liquid shadow abyss. It outlined him, making the light in the room very small. It kept increasing, moving, devouring the empty light in the room. It swallowed the warmth in the room and crept towards her feet. She felt the overpowering and sinister force of darkness. She tried to take in gulps of air, but the tightening and thinness in the atmosphere stopped her breath. 
Ner locked his eyes with hers, his eyes glinted, a blue circle forming in them, glowing neon, then changing to scarlet. She stood frozen as the dark shadowy abyss came closer to her feet, surrounding her entire being. And she felt her heart stop. She could not breathe. She could not think. All she could feel was the overpowering darkness and the fear building up, grim and disturbing. Her whole body shook, vibrating unwillingly.
Ner saw Miss Dove shake violently; she looked frail and ghostly pale. He thought he would have to do more than Phase One of Dark Interpretations that he had read in the manual, yet Phase One seemed fitting. He closed his hand, placing his fingertips within his palm and the black flame dissipated.
The shadowy abyss, slowly eased away from her and found its place in the colour of his suit.
The light filled the room again yet Emma continued to shake, petrified with fear. Ner placed his hand back into the coldness of his pocket, he felt the Gold Watch and it ticked as he touched it, grasping it in his hand. He stood staring at her, waiting for her senses to return.
She fell to the ground, still shaking, and then moved backwards as she sat, her spine hitting against the cold wall. She forgot the doubts of his claims, she forgot she had asked for proof, she forgot she had an option to refuse, she huddled near the wall, her hands clutching her knees and her face smothered in weeping tears.
She had seen fear, it was the Son of Death.

Chapter 3
‘You need light to see the dark'

Two days later.
The fearful scene, where darkness loomed and hovered, eating her skin in fear, had faded. Emma Dove, now on friendly terms with her companion, Ner Relc Alcott, had grown accustomed to his ways. Today Emma sat by her desk while Ner leaned against the wall, a book in his hand as they discussed the characteristics of the Vampire in question. Emma knew a few things of Vampires, she had watched Dracula countless times and was fascinated by the supernatural existence of Vampire’s lives.
“Vampire in question?" She raised her head to face him.
"His previous name was Alistair Collins. Considering how he continues to live, he probably changed his name to adapt and exist on Earth," he said, his face expressionless. He kept his gaze on his book.
"Any other characteristics?"
"Vampires lust after luxury, yet they cannot depart with funds easily," he said.
"That describes most of humanity," Emma murmured. "Don’t Vampires live in tombs, wooden coffins?" She said in deep thought, thinking of all the Vampire stories she had heard when she was young.
"Tombs? Coffins? Don’t some humans bury their dead in coffins?" Ner asked, he lifted his face from the book and arched his black eyebrow at her.
"Well, yes they do, but this is supernatural. Vampires are meant to sleep in coffins, have white pale skin and fear sunlight. They hate sunlight," she said thoughtfully.
"Ah." He heard himself say the syllable that annoyed him.
She seemed to be describing the Council members with their awful scaly, pale white presence. They wore dismal grey robes, their eyes blinded by light, and their memories were a waste of memory. But they did not sleep, even though their eyes seemed half slit and phased with weariness.
"Coffins you say? Well," He thought for a second, "Perhaps they do." He thought about Vampires, there weren’t many books on the topic of Vampires in his library, but there was one that highlighted their greed for gold, jewellery, fine arts, and the wealth of life. The books never mentioned if they slept, or where they slept. He assumed if they were undead they would be like him and his father. The ones who had never lived or died never slept, therefore tiredness was never an issue, but assumptions without proper evidence were untrustworthy. Ner could not leave out the research of Vampires on Earth, perhaps the research on Earth had importance - they had experienced Vampires for many years.
 A fear of sunlight, interesting, Ner thought. Vampires would only devour souls at night. This narrowed their search to beings that hunted at night time.
"Please continue, your knowledge on these rotting creatures." Ner returned his gaze to his book, then he turned the page.
"They drink human blood to survive, hypnotise humans, can shape shift to bats, have sharp fangs," She moved her fingers towards her teeth pointing where exactly the sharp fangs would be and gesturing just how big they were, "Folklore has it written, when someone dies a violent death, where blood scatters everywhere the body is tainted and turned into a Vampire. Well, my mother said that some folklore has it written."
Ner's gaze left his open book for a second time, to stare at Emma as she demonstrated the sharpness of the teeth of a Vampire. The knowledge on these creatures known as Vampires on Earth seemed to be well researched, that most of it sounded fictitious. They had sharp fangs? Change to bats? Hypnotise humans? But he could not really rule this out. This made Ner sigh, which sounded like a growl.
"I’m not certain on the hypnotizing, or the change to bats, but I do believe and I am certain they drink blood." He knew that was true. He read that the sole purpose of draining blood was to reach the soul Spark. Once the blood was sapped the Spark became visible through the body, and absorbed within the Vampire, it would sustain and lengthen their life.
Emma opened an empty book on her desk, found her blue pen and began to write. She began with a title,
‘Vampire Characteristics: Alistair Collins’ then she wrote,
1. Changed Name (Imposter)
2. Lives in luxury
3. Lives in coffins
4. Non-sunlight
She stopped and looked up at Ner.
"Where else would Vampires live? To find ‘x’ we need to have some constants, our linear equation is composed of variables, so far we have luxury, coffins and lack of sunlight," she said, staring at him, waiting for an answer. 
"Vampires would have a way with words, coercing people to their will. Almost a type of hypnotism," Ner said, linking his words to Emma's suggested characteristics, "They should be charming individuals, they enjoy people or drinking people." He reviewed the research he had just read. 
Emma snorted a laugh at his comment and said, "Negative radicand."
She laughed harder at the forbiddance of it all. Her loud laughter interrupted his thought process and she was all giggles, laughing at the two words she had spoken.
Negative radicand?
That was possibly human humour, something he would never understand. He had heard humorous tales that the Council shared, he had never understood the humour behind them, but the Council members would laugh, lifting their heightened musical voices, except for his father of course.
Her laughter stopped and she caught him staring at her with an icy gaze, so she decided to explain.
"In mathematics you usually cannot have a negative radicand, the square root number," She tried to explain further, yet his expression did not change, he just stared plainly at her, holding his book.
"Yes, it is a rule that usually the square root of any number cannot be a negative, even if you do have one it is necessary to use the imaginary unit 'i' this converts it to a positive." He said, his expression unchanged. 
She pressed her lips forward in silence. Even though he knew the meaning behind the negative radicand he did not laugh, just stared at her with that cold dead gaze, she felt awkward about that. It was every mathematician's favourite joke!
"I read this in one of your books," He finally said, moving from the wall.
He reached her bed, sat on it and it sunk in with his dark presence. His hand was still occupied by the green book he read, he looked at Emma, her face was sour and she frowned. He sighed feeling slightly sentimental, yet quite sure that was impossible.
"I shall tell you one of the humorous jokes I’ve heard, that has sparkling white teeth chattering," He said and her face relaxed. He tried to recall the joke the Council members had giggled at, it was apparently meant to be the funniest joke he had heard in his entire non-living existence. He snapped shut the book he held, then it disappeared leaving a grey smoky substance in the air then eventually faded.
"There were five dead men walking. One of them said if you find a snake I will give you a gold coin." He sighed which came out like a growl and continued, "The other four replied if you find my life I’ll find you a snake." His voice had crispiness as he spoke.
Her eyes drew in immediate confusion as she waiting for the punch-line, but Ner sat still and quiet as though his silence was the punch-line. She could not quite comprehend the hilarity of his raspy words. She never truly understood some of the normal human jokes that were out there such as the blonde with the light bulbs.
She wondered why his joke seemed like a mathematical problem in her mind 5 men, 1 snake, 1 gold coin, 5 lives? She was eager to write down an equation and begin solving the joke, yet she hesitated and questioned Ner.
"I don’t really understand it?" Her eyes queried his expression for a further explanation.
"Neither do I." He said smoothly.

***

It was noon when Emma and Ner reached one of the city’s cemeteries. It was surrounded by a tall iron black gate, the gate had a flower spear pattern. The entrance was an arch with a hefty sign above, ‘Stories in Stone.’ There were millions of grave stones erected near each other, some of them were slightly eroded causing the words that were engraved unreadable. Yet the grass was mowed to perfection, there was more green grass than the park. Yet not a flower was seen, not on the graves, not anywhere it was just green grass and grey stones and a black gate giving an eerie atmosphere.
Ner read the graves, as he glided through the pathway. Emma stayed close to him, cowering in his shadow as he walked with confidence searching for an expensive mausoleum. There was one with two sets of marble pillars on the sides of a large golden door. It had silver circular patterns on the edges and the door knobs where made of the silver steel.
"This looks perfect for the Vampire, don't you think?" Ner asked Emma, reaching for the silver steel.
Emma and Ner had compiled a list of the likely places that a Vampire would dwell, they had found the cemetery was an obvious choice, which led Emma to find the most expensive cemetery and land property in the cemetery, it ended up being the 'Stories in Stone' cemetery, it was like a picturesque garden of graves. Instead of rainbow coloured flowers they were grey tombs, and then there were white marbled mausoleums resembling trees. It was very well presented and peacefully organized.
"Uh, uh I don’t think I... uh can go in," Emma staggered out, hanging on to Ner’s arm nervously. He did not seem bothered by her gripping hands, she had slowly moved closer to his body as they entered the cemetery.
First she was a distance behind him then moved nearer, then she was like his shadow, gripping at his the edge of his tailored vent. She moved closer pressing her body to his arm, and then eventually squeezed her hands around his arm in a tight grasp.
"There is no time to think." He lied, he always thought before he acted, analysing everything he did before he was about to do them. Then it became automatic, that his brain would already analyse the best solution to any problem mentioned.
He opened the door, it slightly creaked against the floor. There were lights in this mausoleum and a casket was seen on top of marble rock. Emma was relieved that there was light shining in the mausoleum. She held on tightly to Ner as they entered the tomb, there was a Promethean bronze casket in an urn shape, it was solid bronze an expensive comfortable coffin that glistened in the light.
An undead being would enjoy the comfort of this coffin. The most comfortable bed could not compare to the price of this coffin. Ner placed his hand on the coffin, took a quick glance at Emma, her eyes closed and she gulped as she understood that he was going to open it. He pried it open and he saw the interior finish of blue velvet. No being, no body, no undead, no Vampire stared back at him. It was empty, hollow and velvet blue.
"Next one," Ner said walking out, dragging Emma with him.
They had reached their last mausoleum in the whole green cemetery and had found another velvet blue interior coffin empty. Vampires did not seem to sleep in coffins any more as their previous encounters with the mausoleums and expensive coffins proved this, they had found a few rotting corpses and Emma was surprised that the corpses did not carry the dead stench of decay. Many of them were empty, as if people were preparing their deaths in advance.
Ner and Emma walked from their last mausoleum excavation, they had been here for six hours and the sun began to set, the orange horizon created a deadly ambience, wishing to summon the dead to creep from their graves and devour the living.
And then something growled.
Emma’s stomach growled, she was feeling rather weak as they walked from the mausoleum. The fearful excitement had taken much of her energetic breakfast. She slouched as she walked and the sun faded making her feel more tired and miserable.
"I’m hungry," She finally said out loud, not caring if he was the Son of Death.
"Hunger? Never experienced it." He said, his voice raspy and uncaring. He coolly walked in front of her, his hands in his pockets, hearing her heave her feet behind him.
"Humans cease to exist where hunger is concerned!" She said irritated by his response.
"Read in a research journal, it is the same for Vampires," he said casually.
"You do not eat, I can’t keep up. Have some consideration for the human who is helping you!" She said loudly, storming off in a huff towards the vehicle parked outside the cemetery.
He stared, surprised by the stomping energy she had. He watched her leave, her blue coat shaping her slender silhouette. Consideration he thought. What exactly did that mean? He had attempted earlier with a shared joke, that in the end they both did not quite grasp and ended in awkward silence. He wondered why he even bothered with the shared joke. He then glided to the car passing Emma in the process, he reached the car first and waited, leaning boredly against the maroon vehicle.
She witnessed him easily passing her, she tried to rapidly jog feeling angered, and then she went as fast as she could and tried to outrun him but failed miserably. Her legs stopped and she panted and cursed as her hands fell to her knees and her body hunched over. Her eyes stared at the pebbled floor in front of her. She was not much of a runner nor was she the athletic type, but could he not at least have the decency to let her win. This Son of Death was quite heartless and emotionless, and she was being somewhat childish, as if she desired his attention.
"Hah!" She said loudly that the tombstones felt her annoyance. Impossible his attention, not in a million years! Her stomach growled again as she finally caught her breath and began to walk towards her car. She caught him staring at the stars. Probably searching for which star to snuff out. She smugly thought to herself. Evil Son of Death she would ignore him. She found her key and opened the front door, never bothering to glance his way.
He just stood there waiting as she entered and seated herself, then moving her hand to find the safety belt. Ner quickly transmitted himself to the seat next to her, looming dark and brooding coolness. She began the ignition and the drive. The entire drive was silent, he was used to silence.
The silence was interrupted by a polyphonic melody, it sounded like an advertisement. She heard the sound, realising it was her cellphone, she quickly parked her car on the side and the car behind her whooshed by.
She found her cellular phone and answered cheerfully, forgetting the existence of the dark presence seated beside her.
"Hi granddad!" She cheered up.
Ner turned towards the window as Emma answered her phone, his third day on Earth was unexpected, and he did not know it would take this long to find one Vampire. He had hoped to be home within a week after he had solved this Section 3.4.3.1 problem, he would then continue to learn more of the dreaded business, roam in the grey and blackness of the Council and finally hear them proclaim him as the new Death. Yet here he still sat with the unsolved Section 3.4.3.1, and Miss Emma Dove who wished him to be considerate. Vampires seemed to be tricky creatures, or on Earth standards non-existent.
They were used as fables, entertainment to scare children and even adults.
"Uh, dinner sounds great. Well I am with uh...uh... a friend, he doesn’t eat," she said her lips pursed in wonder, "I mean he doesn’t eat much." She rolled her spectacled eyes towards her right window.
"Okay see you soon. Love you," She said hanging up the phone.
She silently got back on the road still ignoring Ner. He sat making her passenger seat look far too gloomy, she quickly glanced at him but her eyes focused on her white chair, the covering was turning black. She better hurry to dinner, before her white covers became permanently black.

***

She was uncomfortable in restaurants, but this one was fine. She had been coming here ever since was little, her grandfather knew the owner, they used to be business partners. The restaurant was red, it had red carpets and crimson wallpaper, and the tables were fashioned from bloodwood. It was called the Red Restaurant for that very reason. She entered and Ner followed behind her, he glanced at the change in scenery, the redness made him think of the alarm that would flash within the Council office complex back at home. Yet this was in the absence of the flash, it probably suited a Vampire’s taste. Ner thought, the enjoyment of suction of blood being one of their hobbies, they must like the colour red. Emma found her grandfather’s table, he stood up and hugged her. She had seen him and her mother on Tuesday and today was Friday.
Ner remained standing, feeling like the dark shadow he was. People stared at him leaving their plates untouched, they were automatically frightened by his presence. As if he was about to devour them.
"Ah, granddad this is Ner Relc Alcott," She moved her hand towards Ner, introducing him, "Ner, this is my granddad Mr Mathews."
Ner said nothing, the old man stood up moving his hand for a greeting. Ner removed his hand from his pocket and shook the old man’s hand.
"Good to meet you Mr Alcott," Mr Mathews said, feeling a chilling coldness when he touched the young man’s hand, he then quickly released the embrace. He sat down, and Ner followed his lead, seated opposite from Mr Mathews. Mr Mathews rubbed his hands together, trying to erase the icy feeling that lingered on his hand.
"I ordered for you, Emma. But did not know what your friend might have." Mr Mathews said feeling rather awkward as Ner pierced his devilish glazing eyes at him.
"He won’t have anything," Emma said, then added, "His full from the grey lunch we had."
"Ah, so you’ve been together since lunch then?" Her grandfather said curiously.
"Yes, I happen to be stuck with him on a project." She said distastefully.
"Oh, so that is it. So he is a part of your class then?" He asked.
"Uh...uh... yes he is. He is also fairly new so they paired him up with me," she said quickly.
"What is the project on?" Her grandfather said merrily, trying to bring some sort of comfortable conversation, he had learned talking about things that interest another person was always comfortable conversation.
She tried her best to keep calm with a lie on her tongue. "History of Calculus," she managed, "How it all began, the important equations and how it is relevant in today’s society."
"Calculus, a happy past time," her grandfather said. "More happy that it is in my past." He then chuckled, picking up the glass of water to his lips.
The waitress approached their table, placing the plates of warm food on the red clothed table. "Will that be all?" she asked politely.
Mr Mathews stared at Ner, waiting for him to order something. Ner just sat silently observing the exchange between the humans.
"A bottle of that lovely red wine," Mr Mathews then said looking up at the waitress.
"The usual then, Mr Mathews," the waitress smiled.
He nodded and then thanked her. The waitress walked away from their table to fetch the bottle of wine.
"Ner, you resemble a man I once knew, he liked wine," Mr Mathews said, "Would you also like some?" He asked Ner.
Ner gazed at the aged man. He had brown eyes, almost fading to blue, yet his face was robust and he oozed happiness and life. Ner concentrated on the old man’s sentence, it lingered in his head. A man he resembled? The only man Ner knew who truly resembled him was his father. Perhaps this greying man had met his father? But why would his father have a social interaction with a human? Ner thought and accepted the offer of wine from the aged man.
"Wine would be agreeable," Ner said in a low voice.
Mr Mathew smiled, the acceptance of his offer meant that Ner was ready to talk, have a more friendly conversation, meaning more questioned would be answered. Many mathematicians were a recluse group, never liking the outdoors nor social gatherings, he had seen his late brother in law and his uncle having the same symptoms as they were lecturers in the field of mathematics, they had lost their sense of the outside world or reality as they were fonder of numbers than human contact.
Ner resembled the type. Emma also had those qualities but he always encouraged her to appreciate the outside, he usually forced her to outdoor activities that he enjoyed. He hoped she would enjoy them too eventually. If you spend more time in something you are bound to enjoy it.
"Where are you from Mr Alcott?" Mr Mathews asked curiously. The younger man looked very foreign, possibly too foreign to be from Earth but stranger things have happened.
"Far North." Ner said his black bluish eyes locked with the old man, Mr Mathews could not move his gaze away.
"Which part of the North?" Mr Mathews asked his eyes hardened at Ner’s.
"He’s Russian." Emma’s voice squeaked, her mouth was filled with flat baked bread.
"Russian? His accent does not sound Russian." Mr Mathews said perplexed, he continued to stare at Ner curious about his heritage.
"His father is Russian," Emma said quickly trying to stuff her face with meat. Lying was easier when one was hungry. "He gets offended about his past Grand-dad. Race and social issues." She ate as she spoke, nodding at the same time.
"Hmm," Mr Mathews said. His tone was one of understanding acceptance as if Emma’s explanation was sufficient. Mr Mathews then nodded, cutting his steak with his knife. He thought of Emma’s words, which would explain Ner’s hostile gaze, Mr Mathews had experienced inequality, knew the anger that burnt within for narrow-mindedness, the discrimination one had to endure because of the skin you were born with. It was best not to pry into issues such as this, he himself was uncomfortable with questions of his past. He decided to change the topic and asked Emma.
"Will you still be free for the Gallery Exhibition? Your mother cannot make it, work keeping her."
"Exhibition?" Ner asked his voice still dark and low. It made Mr Mathews blink a couple of times before he could actually reply.
"Ah, yes. I’ve been given three tickets to an art gallery exhibition at Depth Gallery," Mr Mathews hesitated at first then he asked.
"Would you like to join, Mr Alcott?"
"No." Emma spurted out, almost spitting out the water that she drank.
Her grandfather and Ner both looked at her. Her grandfather in surprise, Ner with a curious eye brow arched.
"Anyone important coming?" Ner asked, sipping the red wine. It tasted like rust.
Her grandfather’s face lit up in delight at the question. He and his wife always enjoyed discussing about the famous people in the city and one day meeting them, it was more him who found delight in the topic.
"Oh yes, glad you mentioned it Ner, may I call you Ner?" He did not wait for a response and continued, "Well, all the celebrities will be there, you know all them, those you read in the newspaper. And it is Ned Reese Allen’s exhibition! It was luck that I got these tickets. You must know him Ner." Mr Mathews beamed.
Famous people. Ner assessed Mr Matthews’ words. Famous people will attend, all the famous people within the city, it was the perfect time to find a lurking Vampire who enjoyed fame and recognition. Both the research books from Earth and the ones Miss Underwood had given him stated similar characteristics about the greed of wealth and fame of a Vampire. Despite the slight disappointment he felt at the mausoleum, he had a satisfying feeling that his trip to Earth would be at an end, he would achieve his goal and finally improve his research in the mannerism of the undead and even humanity.
"Of course, I’ll join. It should be interesting." Ner grinned, making a sound which came out like a growl.
Emma just watched as her grandfather despite the previous interrogation of background status, he now seemed to treat Ner as a long lost friend. He smiled when Ner accepted his invitation, she could tell he was glowing. Emma did not understand this sudden change of heart but at least her grandfather would not pry so much into the mission of her new friend, Ner Relc Alcott.

Chapter 4
‘The past is what we are’

He was a Vampire, known and referred by Death as one of the undead abominations. There were only a few books dedicated towards the life, or the after-life, or forbidden-life of Vampires. One particular book had coloured illustrations of a Vampire’s body. One image represented the insides of a Vampire - when a Vampire failed to eat for three months his insides would begin to decay. The Vampire's heart would beat much slower due to the amount of blood in the body drying up into a grey sludgy mess. Clots of grey sludge would prevent the proper blood flow, hurting the Vampire with a pain so severe that the electrons in its brain would almost explode. The heart would begin to turn grey as it dried, as if the life force was being sucked out. The lungs would cease inhaling, the muscles would turn arid, the joints would be almost unmovable, the bones would dehydrate, and the skin would rot in its parched state. Overall, the whole body of the undead would stop functioning, like a clock without batteries.
Unless the Vampire found new batteries, soul Sparks.
They needed to feed on people, they would roughly bite their teeth into the neck, devouring the crimson fluid of life until they reached the bright ignition of life that was revealed after draining all the blood.
The blood tasted rather disgusting to a Vampire, like rust. Blood was never meant to be drunk, it had hardly any nutrients, but needed to be pumped for survival. Any Vampire preferred solid food to blood.
The Spark would be absorbed within the Vampire and the body would begin to respond in glee, life had entered, the grey dried sludge flowed into a river of red, clot free in the veins, the heart pumped with content, the muscles were transformed to pink and healthy, and the bones were white and solid. The grey gloom and restless ache of death had faded until the next three months.
The undead Vampire felt the symptoms of death seeping in, he stood in his luxurious penthouse, the walls were painted a grey white and his floors were sparkling silver clean almost clinical clean. He stood in front of the broad transparent window overseeing the city lights very similar to glistening fireworks that never ended until the sun decided to rise. He stared into the night, enjoying the sight until he felt his heartbeat slightly off tune, the rhythm was slowing down. Instead of the heightened tempo in the orchestra, it was the subtle tones of a near end.
His end.
It was indeed the tone of death seeping into his blood and veins. He could last one or two more days, well, perhaps a third. He lifted the glass of whiskey to his lips, felt the liquid on his tongue, and gulped it down. He did not feel the burn in his chest, but the numbness was there. He had an overview of the city, and as one of the richest men in this city he owned investors, investors who owed him. His name was Alistair Quinn, and the buildings he owned were named Quinn. He had the tallest glistening skyscraper in the city. He lived in his penthouse on the top floor the casino and hotel he owned. 
This life was almost great, he had immortality, he had defeated Death in the five minutes he had to live. Well... he and his fellow undead members had not really defeated Death, it was an assumption made by many, and so those who 'defeated' Death like him had helped the myth spread. He, like some of his other undead members, originated from Earth. He was born with his own unique Spark of humanity, connected to the Earth Clock that was linked to Death. He was linked to the whole Clock system until he had died at the ripe age of 88 and revived after the five minutes. Strangely, his body had not remained as the aging old man he was, but as the youthful twenty-seven year old he once was. His golden hair was shampooed, conditioned and smartly cut every Thursday at the uptown saloon, Harry’s Hair. He wore expensive clothes, enjoyed tailored suits, he had them in every shade possible, double-breasted, single-breasted, four button cuffs, three button cuffs.
Yet, his reflection in the window revealed him to be shirtless and shoeless and whiskey-less. He met his own blue eyes in the dark reflection of the bright lights. He placed his arm against the window and reminisced about why this life was only almost great. It always lacked something, it lacked the past, it lacked her. Esther.
Esther, his heart ached remembering. Esther, she was called to her family and friends, but to him she was his first and only true love. He remembered her bright smile that stole his heart, her laughter that made him smile, her lips that he cherished, the memories of her, he now craved. Every detailed memory of her he kept them within him, the silkiness of her brown hair, her pink pouting lips, her firm nose, her strong emerald eyes, the small beauty spot under her eye, the way she walked, he had etched everything about her within his heart. 
His mind trailed back to the past he craved, thinking of the day they met. Thinking of each valuable day spent with her, each minute, each second with her. How he missed her, he missed her, he missed her terribly. 
His mind paced forward in a memory to the day he had proposed to her. He smiled at the thought as he recalled that day, trying to hold back the ache in his chest. 
It was a cold and windy day, he had planned this proposal day for weeks, figuring the best way to propose, the correct words to say, the best riddled notes he could come up with. Alistair knew Esther was curious, she loved to solve mysteries and investigate, inspiring her to study towards her degree in Law. And when he thought about his proposal and her, he realised it needed mystery and investigation to actually keep her intrigued and eventually surprise her. So he had thought about it, considering the things she liked, the things she did not like and then he thought of the most brilliant proposal, he would leave a trail of hidden riddled notes for her to discover and uncover.
He had secretly placed five treasure hunting notes in all the significant memorable places that they had shared together. The first place he had casually hid the secret riddled note was at her house, he had found his way in her bedroom and openly positioned it on top of her law books on her wooden desk, this would be the obvious place she would look as she always needed to reference her textbooks for her assignments.
After he had secretly placed all five of them, he quickly ran back to her house and stealthily panted, looking at the watch she had given him. It was almost 3 pm, he found his way to a hiding spot, behind a pillar that was near her doorstep. She would promptly arrive at 3pm. He loved the way she was always on time, she never missed an appointment whilst he was always late for almost everything and this is what prompted her to buy him a watch, she constantly scolded him on the importance of time, it was something that no-one could really control or get back.
He was hidden from her sight as he spied her returning home, she yawned in her dark green coat, removing her keys from her bag and entering the door, after she entered she took a while to return outside.
"Esther, you are meant to be out by now," he whispered to the cold as he waited anxiously for her to come out of her house.
"I want to see your expression. You always nag me, how time is important!" He complained quietly, staring at his watch impatiently. He waited a few more minutes hiding behind a pillar, "It's very cold Esther, hurry and find the note." He said, jumping up and down trying to keep himself warm and less anxious.
A few more minutes later, Esther leapt from her door into the outside cold, shuffling her coat on her body and beanie on her long brown hair.
"Finally! Geez, you have no compassion for your boyfriend who has been standing and waiting for you in this frost." He whined then grinned as he saw her, she had the brightest smile he had seen, his heart fluttered and he could not help but smile. It is contagious, he thought, her smile is contagious.
"Alistair, you dare disrupt my sleep time with a riddle. It better be good!" She whispered excitedly to herself.
She had quickly figured the location on the riddle which was at their usual restaurant, they had become regular breakfasters, lunchers, cafe-ers and dinner-ers that the owner had offered them positions of permanent staff at his restaurant, he even suggested that they stay there. The waiter winked at Esther as she waved Alistair’s first note in the waiter’s face and then he slipped her the next note. Alistair watched her, doing his best to hide from her keen eyes, as soon as she read the note she immediately ran off not really thinking about the riddle. He must have made the riddles very easy he thought as he attempted to follow behind her energetic speed. He found her at the park, which was the correct third location. She was very good, or more like his riddles were useless. She was in the sand pit digging out the sand with a toy spade.
"Alistair, I'll bury you in this sand pit! How can you place a note here, in this freezing cold?" She muttered her curses at him. He blocked her death wishes from his ears as he secretly watched her nearly dig all the sand out of the pit to find the note, luckily it was cold and no children were playing within it. Otherwise Esther would have found a way to make the kids help her dig.
The sand pit riddle had made her find her way to the gardens where they had numerous picnics and this was the very first place they had met. He followed her quietly grinning as she had discovered every riddle correctly, the final location was at the train station. He stood behind her as she found the last note given to her by the security guard at the train station, she opened it and all was written was 'turn around' and when she did, she saw him and he saw her. She smiled brightly again as she found the final answer to the riddle, his breath caught as he saw her smile. Contagious smile. He found himself breathless. How could she always make him breathless with smile or even one glance?
"Turn around!" She laughed out, reading out the note, her eyes filled with love as she found his, "The last riddle is meant to be the most difficult, is this the best riddle you could come up with?" She asked still laughing, "I thought you were a master riddler." She teased, "But what are you doing here? Are you all I get after my hard work and effort?" She walked towards him and wrapped her arms around him.
"Yes! Esther, you get me." He grinned and hugged her close, "You get me Esther, even though you already have all of me." He closed his eyes feeling the warmth of her body against his, "You have me," he whispered in her ear. He moved his hands to her arms, rubbing them nervously.
"What's wrong? Are you nervous?" She asked. "You're nervous that I found out all your difficult riddles," she said, "or are you nervous because even though I have all of you I want more? You know how greedy I am."
He smiled, "Oh yes, my girlfriend is the greediest of them all. It was your greed for me that made you withstand the sandpit."
"Argh! That sand pit! I will place your head there. Did you watch me dig that enormous pile of dirt? That is no place to place a riddle." She hit him on the shoulder softly. "You should put it under the slide or under a visible rock! Not a sandpit. In the previous clue you kept mentioning sand this, sand that, sand. Sand. Sand."
He smiled down at her angry face, kissed both her cheeks then looked her straight in the eye, his heart beating a nervous storm.
"What's wrong? If you look at me that seriously, you're going to make me nervous." She said, trying to glance away, "Oh are you worried about your riddle? It actually was not that bad." She tried to cheer him up.
He continued to stare at her, his heart pounding, wondering if she could hear it.
"Al, you are acting strange." She said, trying to figure out what exactly was wrong, "Are you okay?"
But he did not say anything, instead he took in a courageous breath and knelt down before her on one knee. He reached for his pocket, revealing a ring within his open hand, in front of her.
"You now have me on bended knee." He said still keeping his gaze locked with hers. “You have always had all of me, but now you have me on one knee.”
Her eyes widened, "Oh!" She let out in surprise, her heart wrapped in sudden joy. "Alistair." She said in disbelief, staring down into his eyes, her eyes suddenly tearing up, "This is the train station."
"This is the train you decided to step out to stay with me." He smiled, holding her hand in one of his, "Even through the rushing crowd, you darted out to hug me when I was at my most miserable. You missed the train for me and I thank God you missed it. And now at this train station you abandoned for me, I ask with sincerity like no other. Would you continue to abandon train stations and their trains? Would you step out and dart into my arms through any obstacles? Through sandpits and pathetic riddles? Would you Esther Rose become my wife?"
She tried to hold back her tears of happiness, she could not say anything at the moment and just nodded her head. He shakily slipped the ring on her finger. "Sandpits and riddles. I will love you forever Esther Rose," he said, embracing her, his hands moved to her face and traced the contours of her brow, and cheeks, and chin. "I love you." He whispered, staring into her eyes, "I love you, I think I must have loved you before time and space. You have to promise me, whatever the circumstances, come hell or high water or any other obstacle this universe can throw in our way, me and you are forever. Remember this, if you are ever lost, I'll definitely find you." 
"And what if you get lost?" She asked, warm in his embrace.
"I can never get lost, all I have to do is think of you, say your name and that alone becomes my compass, my guide to you. I'll never get lost when I think of you."
She nodded her head in his hands. He felt he could not do anything else because his heart ached to kiss her, so he did, he closed his eyes and sealed all the promises he had made with the gentle kiss on her lips.
He shrugged off the memory, his heart wanted to remain there, aching to let the memory go, he missed her. He really did miss her. 
Even though he had met her again, away from his human life, she was not complete. He had met what he thought to be her Spark. 
He still missed her. She looked very different, her hair the colour of sunset, eyes still green as ever. They did say the eyes were the window to the soul. Her personality had not changed much, yet she constantly struggled to remember. 
She was a different person. Someone he knew, someone he still thought of, someone he loved, someone who had been taken too early. He would get her back fully, it was possible. The uttering of her name was his compass to find her, he had promised, and by his undead life he would bring her back. The impossibilities of this life were possible, he was an example of this. The others he had escaped with were examples of this. There was hope, there was always hope and more importantly a realistic way to gain what you truly wanted, what you truly deserved.
"Esther, you'll be back." He promised, touching the watch on his wrist.

***

She woke, glad to feel the sunlit warmth through her yellow curtains. The sunlight entered her room, the yellow curtains enhanced the light and it made her room more cheerful, brightening the white walls. She liked the sunlit mornings when the sun would rise and her room was filled with a wonderful sunlit glow, it started her day in positivity. Yet this time she hardly saw the sunlight, there seemed to be a brooding darkness in her sight.
"Don’t you ever sleep?" She yawned her hair a tangled mess.
"Death doesn’t sleep, neither does his son." He replied, looking up from his book to watch her. He stood near the table filled with maps and books. Her hair was everywhere in stiff positions, it looked like a root that had ventured deep into the soil seeking water. Her eyes remained closed, her face half lit by the kiss of the sun. She stretched her weary arms and slowly opened her eyes, she could see blurs of light and then a black smudge of a figure. Ner, she thought, trying to find her bright spectacles on her end table.
Ner could not concentrate when she opened her eyes, with the sunlight’s glow brightening her sleepy expression. Her green eyes, emerald green mixed with harlequin green, looked like gems, glistening with soul, glistening with life. He had been surprised the first morning when she woke up, watching her eyes move with slow hesitation.
He felt an odd twinge in his empty chest. He hated the colour green, yet he had to admit her eyes were a mix of beauty and… and… something he could not describe. Her mixed emerald and harlequin eyes coerced him to delight in the shades of green. 
His unfortunate brain kicked at him, listing all the different shades of green. This time he did not bother to understand why it had hiccupped back on the green colour, he ignored it and continued to stare at her. 
She fumbled around for her glasses and put them on, yawning once again. She was used to Ner hovering in her room, eyeing her as if she was some strange mystery. He usually had a book in hand; they never had titles, just different colours.
"What are you reading?" She asked him in a yawn, still tired even though she had slept more than her usual eight hours.
"The Theory of Chaos." He answered as his finger turned the page.
"Chaos? Why would you read that?" 
His reading tastes were odd, she thought, the theory of chaos? And the books he had were even stranger, they were hard covers, no titles, no authors on the cover just a plain solid colour. 
This one was pink.
"It is informative," he replied, his eyes never leaving the book. Ner always answered her questions but his reply was almost as good as silence. 
She wondered if the only purpose he had come was to find the undead. He never mentioned anything else, she should probably ask.
"Why are we looking for a Vampire?"
"Vampires are a nuisance to the balance of the universe." He said, not looking at her.
"Balance of the universe? Besides the sucking of blood, how do they contribute to the balance of the universe?" She asked, still perplexed at his answer.
"The universe has a balance, everything has a balance. When Vampires kill, they suck out the Spark." He turned the page.
"What’s a Spark?" She cocked her head.
The people on Earth were ignorant of worldly events he thought, they knew absolutely nothing of the facts of the universe, the Sparks, the balance of life. Surprisingly, these Earthlings had made fiction of life itself, the undead. They thought Vampires were myths and speculations, they had not facts; they were all so disorganised and ill prepared with their baseless assumptions. How could one live in a world of reality and never desire to know truth? They seemed to be content living in fiction.
"The Spark, is referred to as life. Your soul if you prefer. The universe has a Clock system, it contains the exact second a Spark is born or renewed and it contains the exact time when a Spark is meant to die," he said, his head still bent in his book. "Vampires are forcing the Sparks to die before their time." His head rose, finding her eyes, "This is causing the imbalance."
So the Vampires were murdering innocent Sparks, humans, Emma thought. This was not right, everyone had the right to life. Even though on Earth there were many violent wars and murders, no one ever had a right to take life.
"That’s wrong!" She exclaimed, "Is this how they expand their lives?"
"Yes, the Sparks they consume assist them to prolong their lives. I am here to stop them. They should be dead." Ner lifted his head from his book, examining her expression.
"I’ll help you then, who knows who they might attack." She would help Ner willingly. The Earth already had its many problems with humanity harming itself, it definitely did not need supernatural or rather unnatural beings assisting in the further and rapid demise of more innocent people.
"We will leave as soon as I have showered," she said, positioning her glasses on her face. She leapt from her bed with a new found justice within her soul, eager to find his Vampire. But first she went to the bathroom door.
He kept his gaze on her movements. So, she agreed to help him, but wasn’t she already doing that? 
The explanation had probably opened her eyes, demonstrating the importance of his mission. Sometimes it was best to reveal important details to servants; servants who supported your cause were more of an asset, they were more likely to do their best at serving.
Today was Saturday. She stared at herself in the bathroom mirror. Her brown hair was a horrid mess, but everyone’s was when they awoke, unless they never slept like Mr Son of Death, but his hair was always unruly yet for some reason it still looked neat. Neat and at the same time untidy, well you had to believe in contradiction when the supernatural was involved or what she had recently experienced.
She would assist Ner with his assignment, if she could not help random human beings from murdering each other, the least she could do was to take advantage of this opportunity to stop the undead from killing. After the Vampire was found she expected that everything would turn to normal, everything would be balanced, even though humans themselves would occasionally still continue their crimes and wars.
Sometimes things cannot be helped but she was looking forward to returning to her wonderful equations, and to the blessed warmth and love of her family. She would not need to lie any more about boarding a deadly being in her room. She would be free from fear and the supernatural, she silently longed for the normality. The adventure life was not for her, it tested her fears, made her feel unsafe and frightened at every turn and discovery. She never thought a life of adventure was fun and she was right. She needed to assist Ner, help him with the balance of the nature of the world and get back to her normal reality, the sooner the undead were gone, the safer the world would be and the sooner Ner was gone, the safer she would feel.
***
Ner, Emma and her grandfather walked together. Emma and Mr Mathews walked in comfy warm coats, her arm snuggled underneath her grandfather’s arm. They walked beside each other smiling happily, excited to finally see the exhibition by the famous painter.
Ned Reese Allen.
Behind them Ner walked grimly, he was like the shadow of the people in front of him. He eyed every being that stared at him wondering if they had knowledge of the Vampire he sought. His expression was one of darkness and mystery shadows, his black eyes would shine as he made contact with disdained strangers, and they would raise their eyes in fear and move their faces bent towards the pavement. Ner had agreed with Emma that the rich places people would possibly go to; were places where other rich people would go to, like famous exhibitions. They walked along the pavement and her grandfather gasped in excitement as they reached the door. There was a knee length sign near the side of the double doors it had words indicating the current event.
‘Ned Reese Allen’ Fame and Fortune Exhibition extraordinaire.
There were two men dressed in a blue uniform, they wore caps and blue warm jackets that had an imprint of their names and ‘Depth Gallery Security.’ One was Timothy O’ Malley the other was Gregory Halmes. They both had tired eyes and bored expressions, as if they were waiting for the end of this day.
"Tickets please," Timothy stared at them, as they reached the door step of the entrance. Her grandfather moved his hand in his pockets, searching for the important tickets. He found them and humbly gave them to the security guard.
Timothy passed them to Gregory who had a black machine in his hand, it had a small electronic screen and an entrance to insert the rectangular ticket. He entered one of them and the green screen wrote in big bold letters ‘APPROVED’ the other two did the exact same. Gregory then passed the approved tickets to Timothy who then passed them back to the authorised guests. He then opened the door for them attempting a weak smile, and they swiftly entered the premises.
Emma smiled shyly, for she had stared and gotten the mathematical number from both Timothy and Gregory, during the process of the scan of the tickets. Her grandfather smiled in excitement, he enjoyed arts of any sort he often went with his wife before she had passed. Ner on the other hand stared at Timothy with an intense shadowed gloom, Timothy had raised his eyebrows in concern, for some reason when he saw Ner, there seemed to be a darkness overwhelming him, it outlined his features and made him look so much more taller and intimidating, almost deadly. Ner passed inside the building and the feeling faded from Timothy, he shrugged it off and blamed it on the lack of sleep.
The gallery was extravagant, there was a rectangular table in the centre with a golden covered cloth, it had a variety of expensive delicacies that only the wealthy could identify and truly enjoy and the poor would be delighted to just gaze at. The space was open, with paintings hanging on the walls, they were all framed. The white wall enhanced the paintings features almost making them come alive. Emma stared at everything intensely, scrutinizing every object and sighed in relief when every solid object her eyes had found had a number attached to it. Her father waited for her to get accustomed to the room, he knew that Emma needed to convert almost everything into numerical, it was a gift yet a curse. But he enjoyed the way she gazed at an object intensely, figuring a solution then she would sigh and grin. The grin always made him smile. It seemed she was achieving more than he realised.
He dragged her towards the first painting, it was red and had different shapes. The outline was black the shapes resembled an orange being torn apart. Ner had followed carefully behind them. Ner did not walk he glided, his feet would move taking normal step but it was more like he was sliding through time, sliding instead of walking. It was a ghostly movement.
"What do you think dear?" Mr Mathews asked his granddaughter.
"I see the pattern of 3’s and the total sum of 55." She said one brow arched. Her grandfather laughed, a warm hearty laugh.
"Seems like something being choked, maybe a head.” Ner stared coolly at the painting.
Mr Matthews’ eyes widened at the description mentioned. A head being choked? He began to imagine the round shape was a faceless head and that the scarlet paint splashed in small circular shapes was blood.
"Indeed. I see what you mean Ner." Mr Mathews said, quite stirred from the description and vivid image that Ner had proposed. It was an eerie description. Mr Mathews moved his eyes closer towards the explanatory words below.
The title read ‘A Life Among Us’
"A life among us, interesting title. Wouldn’t you say Ner?" Mr Mathews tried to probe the gruesome brain of his granddaughter’s friend.
"Yes, life is among us but death is so much more prominent." Ner said grimly.
Mr Mathews was stunned by the reply, wondering what exactly brought that thought to mind. Most people were glad there was life among us, it was delightful to dwell in the living.
"Grandfather, it’s rather silly, it is just a painting after all." Emma interrupted her grandfather’s thoughts and hauled him to the next painting. Ner glided behind, not finding anything extraordinary about the paintings but eyeing every person who dared look at him suspiciously and that meant everyone in the entire gallery.
They reached the fifteenth painting after eating a few expensive treats provided by the gallery. And they seemed to fall into routine, first was Mr Mathews asking of the thoughts on the artwork, then it was Emma’s calculations that only made sense to her then it was Ner who made a bleak comment that was similar to a death.
He said painting number two looked like knife being thrown at the heart, painting number 3 was four horses trampling on bodies, painting number 4 resembled two heads being collided into one and the 15th one he commented seemed to look like a man dancing in flames.
"Hmm, a man dancing in flames. Indeed." Mr Mathews said deep in thought. He could see the orange triangles could perhaps be fire and the blue image of an oval in the centre surrounded by the orange triangles was possibly a man. Then his mind tried to vividly imagine the description of Ner’s words, and the frightening image came alive this time the man in the oval shape was Mr Mathews. Mr Mathews stepped back in fright, he looked pale and frailer.
"Are you alright, granddad?" Emma asked concerned. "Maybe you need to sit down?"
He nodded as the image faded from his mind. Ner had seen the old man jump in fright but he blinked as he heard the ringing sound in a tick. He lifted the Gold Pocket Watch, snapped his fingers. And disappeared through frozen time.
Everything froze, the people at the gallery stopped moving their lips, their feet and their voices were silent. It was Death, he needed to do his hourly routine of morbid employment. This was a good time for Alistair and any other undead member to eye someone to devour, but this only lasted a brief minute and a half which was not enough time to actually drain a Spark from a living body. But it did allow one to observe who to hunt, perhaps he should choose someone old they were bound to die sooner, and really all soul Sparks were the same for him they lasted for the exact same period three months before they completely faded, they were his heartbeat but he had someone specific in mind a man called Wyatte Brown. Alistair’s heart would regularly beat every three months before it took the unnatural rhythm. He sipped the champagne and placed the glass on the table. He enjoyed art especially abstract art, Esther also enjoyed art, she had said abstract art revealed one’s soul. The first painting was red, it had a black outline of a round circle then small circles were splattered everywhere on the canvas.
The title was ‘A Life Among Us.’ He knew the painting it spoke to his heart, he saw the essence of life being born, it was all really about the soul Spark. This one was red, yet in reality others were blue. Not all were red. The crimson colour was more than just a blob, it was life being renewed amongst other lives that never saw the importance of life. Yes that was the artwork, A Life Among Us a fitting title for a wondrous painting. He would purchase that painting.
He noticed a petite, or more appetising blonde, she was in a short black dress, grey stockings and her blonde hair fell to the right side of her shoulder brushing her waist length fur coat, that did not really provide much warmth to her skin. In that moment where he analysed his prey everything returned to normal, time began again yet he knew she was not his prey, just another innocent being hoping for a rich husband perhaps. She began to move that meant Death had accomplished his mission for the hour, the blonde lady moved her champagne glass to her lips, not really observing the painting but the people within in the gallery. He decided to use his charm and approached her.
Ner found Emma and her grandfather, she was leading him to the green sofa in the corner.
"You’ll be fine granddad. Just breathe." She sat next to him.
"Ner get him some water," She said quickly out of concern for her granddad.
He unexpectedly followed her instruction, and walked smoothly towards the table, still eyeing an unknown name in the vicinity. The Clock identified all living beings with names, they were all human in this room, he would need to find the other rooms, there must be an undead here. He could sense it, even though he hardly had any senses. It was a Death thing, his icy gaze went along every being visible entering the room as he delivered the glass of water to Mr Mathews. Mr Mathews drank, feeling slightly better he then stood up and desired to continue to view the paintings and the people.
"I’ll leave you have some time alone with your grandfather." Ner said nodding his head to Mr Mathews. He moved towards the white stairs of the gallery.
As Alistair approached the young blonde lady, he froze as he saw someone he knew behind her. His heart clenched. Someone he thought would never exist again. Everyone moved passing around him, even the blonde lady who had expected his advances walked away from him, her face in arrogant disappointment. He did not care, he did not notice he was frozen solid. It was un-expected, it was unreal, it was impossible, yet still she stood there smiling.
He saw her.













Chapter 5
‘Blue skies are nice, but the un-dead prefer grey skies'

He saw her.
She wore red round rimmed spectacles. Her hair was lush and dark brown, it was combed down and settled perfectly against her shoulders. The exact way he had remembered it. Her high cheek bones were splattered with rosy pink, from the cold. She smiled at the old man beside her. He kept his mouth moving and with every word her smile grew bigger. An odd feeling crept upon him as he watched her, and the feeling moved to his face touching his lips and it made him smile. A faint warm smile. He needed to speak to her. It was in his mind, in his body, in his soul. 
Esther, Esther his soul called out in silence. 
He remembered the first time he saw her. It was exactly the same. His heart had pumped a bit too much, a bit too hard as if it would break from his chest, his fingertips were wet with precipitation of nervousness. There was something in that past moment and this particular present moment. The feeling was the exact same. And in both times he needed to speak to her. Hear her rich voice of light. He found his footsteps approaching her, they moved naturally towards her as if she was the light to a moth.
"Greetings." He said interrupting the flow of conversation, wanting to touch her.
The old man turned slightly to face the voice and he was surprised when he recognised the man that stood in front of him. The voice belonged to the richest man in the city of Raines, the newspapers were always intrigued by his efforts of charity work and spectacular ball parties. They said there was never a man like him, he had a mysterious past but his funds made the mystery being investigated disappear.
"Ah, Mr Quinn, Mr Quinn,” Evans Mathews pulled his aging hand excitedly towards the man.
Alistair moved his hand in a strong greet as their hands clasped. His eyes never leaving the woman in front of him. His heart raced, it hit against his chest in excitement. He wanted to touch her, embrace her, he wanted her to know how much he really missed her. How long, all these years he waited to finally see her again. 
She stared at him quite oddly. Her face was one of concentration, her brown eyebrows were not arched as before in comfort, her eyes he could see were green, the green he loved. The green that stole his heart when she laughed and smirked. Yet this time her green eyes pierced at his soul, they never left his face. They were seeking something, staring as if she knew him. Staring to find the depths of his humanity, his reason for living, it seemed to be uncovering hidden parts of his soul, climbing the mountains, overturning every grain, every second that he had lived and unlived.
Then she drew her mouth into an immense grin. He became breathless, he remembered the moments when she found the breeze soothing and she had broadened her lips, there was something that touched his heart every time. He could not get tired of the feeling, never had he experienced a connection with another human being a force that was the existence of life. Esther, he called her name desperately in his head.
She was seeking the number of his soul. She had heard his nervous voice and her grandfather had slightly turned and she followed. As soon as she saw him, he was a mathematics problem desiring to be solved. She finally grinned as she found his face to be a number 11, she then sighed as the image of eleven withdrew from his face. He had the darkest blue eyes she had ever seen, there was something magical about his eyes, as if he was staring at her, lost in a memory. Her grandfather nudged her gently with his elbow.
"Ah, greetings." She said still holding that grin.
The man in front of her smiled slightly, his face and skin were flawless. He was one of those people who looked much like a celebrity, flawless, golden and rich.
"I am Mister Mathews, Evan Mathews this is my granddaughter Miss Dove. Emma Dove," The old man said smiling happily. He had never seen a celebrity close up. It was the sight his wife cherished even though she had died thirty-five years ago. She had always commented on meeting a star, one that was famous for anything and everything. She passed on her dying wish to her husband. She gripped his head fiercely and whispered her dying words of sharing a meal with a celebrity, a man that meant something to the world. Who got tongues wagging and mouths drooling. A man that everyone wanted to rub shoulders with. A man who wore expensive clothes, drank expensive liquor. She was quite creative in her last speech which was very odd for a lady who had hardly spoke, her eyes seemed dim as she spoke with such passion. He supposed it might be her doing from the heavens above, initiating such a purposeful meet. Perhaps she knew he was about to die and persuaded the angels above to enforce her wish upon an old dying man. Evan Mathews quickly looked to the white painted ceiling, closed his eyes and whispered a thank you prayer to his wife.
In the midst of Mr Mathews staring at the ceiling, Alistair nervously found the hand of Miss Emma Dove and pressed his lips upon her fingers. She was real, he thought, her skin was soft, he missed her touch, his heart raced faster at the discovery that she stood in front of him, alive and warm. His gaze never left her spectacles, and he noticed that her rosy pink cheeks turned an adorable red. He was reluctant to let her hand go, but he gently parted with it still staring at her flushed expression.
Miss Dove. Miss Emma Dove. Miss Emma. Emma.
Her current name fitted her perfectly.
Emma.
He kept phrasing it in his head, then he finally noticed that it was similar to Esther. Esther was her previous name. Esther. He had met her in the meadows one summer morning, she had her hair spread out to her shoulders and she was skipping in the meadows in search of some flowers. Instead of flowers she had found him.
Now she was Emma, Emma Dove. She did not know him at all but he could observe from the staring then the blushing there was a connection between them. A Spark. A soul Spark combined. It was fate. It must be fate.
"Do you enjoy the artworks?" Alistair asked looking ravishing.
Mr Mathews responded, "Oh yes, Mr Quinn, they are brilliant." 
"Please call me Alistair." Alistair smiled, a warm smile no one could resist.
"Alistair, my great grandfather had that name. It is a strong name." Evans commented, "Like the oak tree that never withers."
"Strong? You flatter Mr Mathews." Alistair said warmly, staring at Emma.
"If I am to call you Alistair, you will call me Evans." Evans smiled finding this celebrity charming and rather friendly to normal folk.
"And what of your name. Miss Dove?" Alistair asked politely and stared at her intently. There was a glint in his eye as he stared into her eyes, waiting for her response.
Her face was a blush of red, as she tried to keep her eyes level with his.
"It should be alright, if you do call me Emma." She almost stuttered.
He smiled still staring at her emerald eyes, indeed her spectacles covered them but he could see beyond the thick transparent glass, he saw more, he saw the years of memories coming to back to life.
"And it would be more than alright for you to call me Alistair." His tone almost seductive.
They all stood near a painting, it was one Emma and her grandfather were about to examine before Alistair had interrupted. The painting had four black vertical lines in the centre and green horizontal swirls connected them, elevating towards the edged brim of the painting.
"What do you observe from this painting?" Alistair asked as he stared at the artistic expression, thinking about how Esther stood right next to him.
"It’s rather like a cage but all I can see are the shapes." Evans said thoughtfully.
"A cage, yes I can picture it." Alistair kept staring seeking the truth of the painting, there was always more to art than meets the eye.
"I see a sum 24," Emma said with a grin.
Alistair smiled at her observation and Evans grinned with her, "And what do you see Alistair?"
"I see the cage, but it’s quite open. The green swirling are the gifts of life, living. It seems to indicate there is always a way to get life, even though one seems trapped there is always an escape," Alistair said still gazing lost in the painting, his eyes then slanted towards the title. ‘The Lost Dream.’
The lost dream, it fitted his life perfectly. He thought of the entrapment, the escape, the finding. The dream lost that was found. It made sense, the life that he had gained again, everything made sense. It was her that made everything make sense. Emma. Esther. Fate.
"The lost dream," He slowly whispered to himself.
"A person being impaled by spears," A dark voice was heard behind them, the voice had interrupted Alistair’s thoughts. His eyes were drawn back to the painting and the image of the cage had been replaced with spears, and the green swirl in front of the spears resembled a person who was indeed caught in the horrid pain of spears, the person’s blood was swirling green and out of control. Alistair felt disgust at the image, his face turned sour when he could no longer gain the lost dream he had found, that now remained lost. He felt a slight anger rise within him and slowly turned to find culprit who destroyed the artwork. He saw the man standing before him. His features were dark, and his eyes were as night. He knew this grim being, it was none other than the Son of Death.
Ner Relc Alcott.
Time stopped.
Ner’s eyes locked with Alistair. The intense gaze hovered in the air it seemed to slow time itself. The piercing blue eyes met with black. Each knew their mission and purpose. Ner to balance the foundations of nature, errors of nature had to be erased. Everything within the world universe had to work like a clock, always ticking, moving in order. Even when he stopped time the universal Clock would continue to move.
The Clock itself was God; Death and Life were its servants. The Clock proposed the time of birth and the time of death everything in between was a graceful journey of time demonstrating its power. Ner was always victorious, he had been embedded with the need to take life as a cored mission within. It came naturally as time. The whole purpose of his non-existing life and his non-beating birth had a purpose. He would return home victorious, honouring his father’s name and his potential to finally become Death himself.
Alistair’s mission was the opposite it was to find his place in the imbalance. Alistair knew the loophole had a purpose, for if the natural system was perfect the imbalance had to be a part of the perfection. He knew the world in the midst of chaos had more order than the human mind could comprehend. The loopholes were never really errors, they were there for a reason, a discovery to continue to explore and find the purpose, his purpose, his compass Esther. He would bring her back.
Ner walked coolly towards his imbalanced foe. Alistair stood still eyeing him cautiously, he had heard countless of tales about the Son of Death. He was precise in all he did, emotionless and very good at his father’s job. The only resemblance Alistair noted was that Death and his son had the same bluish black eyes. But this time Ner’s eyes were a constant black of erupting smoke, that at times would turn into balls of flames but this time his eyes overflowed with sooty smoke. It was rather disconcerting if one was not used to the unseen things of the natural world.
"Son of Death," Alistair said, his eyes never blinking, but his mouth slightly turned into a forced grin.
"Alistair Collins, rotting abomination." Ner said his eyes dulled with smoke, his expression murky and serious.
Alistair smirked as he heard Ner, a small humorous breath escaped from his mouth. Rotting abomination.
"Ner Alcott. You’ve gotten the same humour from your father. Death’s humour never seems to grow old." Alistair placed one hand in his pocket.
"Death never had a humour, neither do I," Ner gazed sceptically at Alistair, "It’s time."
"Time? Time to engage in more activities of the living." Alistair said, his eyes beginning to draw dangerously dark. Alistair had been a Vampire for at least 10 years. The fables on Earth on Vampires including the one of sparkling were not true. Except of the sparkling of the eyes, Vampires could not hypnotise, they could not shape shift nor did they sleep in cold coffins.
"No, time to die." Ner said disliking this Vampire and his speech.
"I’ve already done that." Alistair said.
"I’m here to make it permanent." Ner retorted.
Alistair knew once Death had found him, he would be unable to run, probably unable to hide. But this was Death’s Son not Death. He had heard of Ner Relc Alcott the rumours said there was never conflict when he was set for a mission. He seemed to do what he was told very swiftly, never really lifting a hand. He did what he was bred to do. In all the rumours that Alistair had heard, the sight alone of Ner brought the will of life into fear, and the fear made his victims’ cowards, he could easily peck the Spark that they were.
Alistair assessed the rumours, assessed Ner.
Ner probably lacked the experience of conflict. The Son of Death never experienced conflict, everything always seemed in order when he took a life. Everything placed in orderly fashion, he knew nothing of real chaos; the will to survive, the darkness or was it the light. Maybe it was both, they were both contained in the Spark. He knew the survival instinct of the Spark, in all his human life and his current undead life. He knew the worth of the Spark, the Sparks of life he had taken. It was more than life itself, there was a fiery will within, the slightest hope to breathe, to remember and to cherish.
It was the Spark.
Ner probably did not understand nor did he ever have to battle for one’s Spark. This would be interesting Alistair thought. He wondered if Ner had ever used the deadly powers that his father had. Had he been taught the vital conflict measures that needed to restrain an opponent?
Alistair thought and he concluded that Ner did not. Well he needed to prove his theory.
"Permanent? Let’s see you try." Alistair challenged, a grin formed on his face. His golden hair covered his eyes as he spoke, making his expression unreadable.
"Don’t think that you can escape. Alistair Collins." Ner said his eyes had a subtle crimson liquid seeping through the edge, it was slowly moving towards the centre of his eyes.
"I’ve escaped Death before, I probably will again," Alistair said his front teeth gleaming white, his hair still shadowed his blue eyes, “If you believe that you can defeat me, I advise you not to make the same mistake your father did.”
"The only mistake is your existence, which I will definitely rectify by ensuring your demise. Your death is guaranteed."
The crimson liquid reached the centre of his eye, it formed a miniature circle and continued to enlarge. Ner’s suit darkened, a shadow was being lifted from his clothing, some of the night shadow crawled from his suit slithering towards the tiled floors, the other clasped itself against the ceiling above. Ner was surrounded by a glowing blackness, he looked terrifying as the seeping wisps of shadow began to slowly turn crimson. Almost like a burning flame.
Alistair stared at the formation of the attack; this resembled the Phase One of Death. He had seen this before, yet never witnessed the scarlet flames that attached to Ner’s shadow. Ner’s whole body shined with burning darkness, bits of his shadow had obtained the seeping lit flame the rest were pure night. As his transformation was revealed Ner still held his normal, un-phased expression. His eyes had changed, his whole body had darkness oozing from it, yet his face remained unchanged, calm and unreadable.
Frightening indeed, even Alistair had been stunned with slight fear as he watched the Son of Death demonstrate his power to devour. Even so Alistair would not reveal his fear, he would not let the will of the Spark vanish.
"Impressive." Alistair said, his golden hair slightly lifted revealing his striking blue eyes, they began to glow brightly then turned an intense violet. His grin showed the sharpened teeth, a growl escaped from his mouth. He would demonstrate the true power of a Vampire, of the Spark.
He whispered foreign words, summoning a curse. Within his body a dark glow ignited, he felt the power spread through his veins, it forced his heart to beat more rapidly, it was a rapid surge building and extending within his entire being.
It was the Spark. The Spark was more than life, it was the power of life, it was a force, it was the gift of life.
As he felt the volt of power move through his body supplying him with supernatural strength, his veins grew more prominent through his skin, they were a visible, protruding black. He ran towards Ner in an instant, then he swiftly moved a second later behind Ner’s shadowed existence. Alistair reached for Ner’s neck an attempt to quickly twist it, for he thought it would bide some time for him to run fast, and Alistair could run damn fast.
Before he could reach, Ner’s face faced his, Ner’s mouth was in a straight line yet his eyes had a grim scarlet humour in them.
"Could you be faster than Death?" Ner asked, "Time and space are my ally," He continued.
Alistair just stared, Ner’s dark shadow had surrounded Alistair, it encircled his body trapping him in the centre, it was a flicking lit reddish and black flame that seemed eager to draw closer to his feet and burn him. He moved one hand to the other, scratching his wrist, intending to make himself bleed. He found the protruding vein, scrapped the surface deeply and the crimson, blackish liquid gushed out in his left palm.
The blood leaked out, covering his fingertips then dripping to the ground. He used his thumb to smear the blood on his other fingertips, he quickly wrote hieroglyphics of a past time on each of his fingertips with his thumb. His left hand was a drenched display of red. He quickly smeared the blood on each fingertip on his left hand, he snapped them, connecting them with his thumb. His hand began to glow, it was a scarlet brightness. The wound on his wrist had healed, yet the blood was still dripping from his left hand. He then took his left index finger that was soaked in blood, and wrote the hieroglyphics on his right fingertips.
After he had written them, he moved back to the pinkie fingertip and drew a connecting line of blood until his index finger reached the thumb. His right hand began to glow, the same scarlet light that his left hand had. He fisted both his hands, Alistair had been an experienced boxer in his past, he was strong yet the undead power made him stronger.
Ner watched, eager to see what powers a Vampire possessed. Even encircled in black flames, this man displayed no fear. Instead Ner witnessed a slight smirk as if he had been waiting for a battle, waiting for a worthy opponent, waiting to brutally kill. He waited as Alistair fisted his hands, wondering about the red glow on his hands. What power was this? Could it be stronger than the power of Death?
Impossible. Ner decided to wait for Alistair’s attack, he was far too curious to begin the first assault, it was far more important to collect research for Miss Underwood, and the lack of information on Vampires.
Alistair leaped to the ceiling, he had lost buttons from his white suit as he leapt, his black shirt showed untucked from his pants. His body was latched towards the ceiling, Ner looked up eyeing Alistair. Alistair’s eyes remained an intense violet, it was a look of an animal ready to hunt, ready to kill its prey. Alistair crawled on the ceiling, he ran on all four limbs moving at a fast speed almost unseen to the eye.
Ner could see the movement, his eyes followed Alistair as he crawled with intense speed, moving diagonally on the ceiling then horizontally. Alistair then found his feet on the ground, he ran towards Ner, punching both his fists towards Ner’s face but Ner blocked the advances. He lifted his hands and Alistair’s glowing hands had touched the side of his arm, Ner’s clothing on his arm began to burn, it looked like a red acid had been thrown on them and it ate at the cloth. Alistair then disappeared, he ran behind Ner again and made contact, his glowing fist had found Ner’s neck, the side of his neck. Ner felt the punch and his skin started to burn. He could not feel the pain but he felt a slight nudge, a tinge of something.
He found Alistair’s violet gaze, "Even Death burns," Alistair smirked.
As Alistair spoke the words, Ner began to heal yet still the odd sensation remained near his neck. Ner walked forward towards Alistair. The Son of Death seemed to have flaming dark wings attached to his shoulders as he walked, his hands had moved from his pockets and he began to write symbols in the air, his hand was like a paintbrush, the air left hints of the symbols he drew.
He had finished and the last symbol was seen for a brief second, it was a smoky circle with flowing lines in different directions. After it evaporated, the atmosphere within the gallery changed. Everything grew heavy and dark, like a grey cloud had landed. The white ceiling walls were shadowed as if night had come, yet this night that crept into the gallery instead of stars that twinkled, it had eyes that opened from their dark state.
They all stared at Alistair with crimson anger. They appeared on every wall and also took control of the floor. Staring, gazing intently at Alistair. Ner lifted his hand, and an encircling flame appeared spiralling around his arm. It kept spiralling, summoning other flames to encircle around his arm. He then sent it forth towards Alistair, it was a flaming whip following Alistair at a lightning speed.
Alistair tried to move, run and dodge yet he stood within one of the eyes Ner had summoned, it had captured his feet. He stood trapped as the flaming whips reached him and then tangled around his wrists, forcing him to submit as it burned his skin and he felt the excruciating throbbing, the melting of skin. Ner walked towards him being led by the flaming thread.
"Death burns? You mean Death is the cause of the burn." Ner said still feeling the slight odd sensation near his neck, it would not disappear even though he had healed.
"Where are the other undead members?" Ner said, hearing Alistair scream from pain.
"I–"
"The quicker you speak, the faster the pain stops."
Alistair felt the flames, the flaming whip was tightening around his wrists, mixing blood and skin in a smoky flame.
"You cannot kill me," Alistair said, "I can help you find them."
"I could find them on my own," Ner lifted his eyes to the Vampire’s face.
"It would take longer, they are vicious creatures and very able to hide in stealth. They have been doing it for years," Alistair said concentrating to keep the pain at bay.
"I take it you wish to make a deal, some sort of transaction for selling your friends?" Ner said arching one of his eye brows.
"Yes, in assisting you let me have twenty more years on Earth." Alistair compromised.
"Twenty years? Alright," Ner lied, “Twenty years it is, but if you dare escape, when I find you, you will die immediately, or perhaps very slowly. You will assist me in finding them and killing them. You will tell me their weaknesses and whatever strengths they have. Do we have an agreement?"
"My wrists have agreed on my behalf," Alistair said.
Ner moved his hand in a gesture, he summoned a vial that scrapped against the floor where Alistair’s blood lay idle, and then the vial disappeared into thin air. The whips of flames then disappeared, the eyes in the shadow night had closed and they crawled to the outside, as if their presence never existed. Ner’s flaming dark wings also vanished into thin air. Ner’s eyes proceeded back to smoky black. The shadow attached its skin on to his suit and everything was filled with light and cleanliness, except for a few drops of blood Alistair had made when summoning the glow of his hands, which had been scrapped by Ner’s vial.
Alistair was on his knees, bending as he rubbed one of his wrists, they were healing yet it was taking longer than usual. Once they had healed there was slight scarring on the edges. Whatever flame the Son of Death used left scars, he seemed more powerful than Death himself. Something about him was unusual Alistair thought staring at the scars that remained on his once flawless skin.
He stood from the ground, feeling disappointed that he had lost and that he would need to assist the Son of Death. His friends he had escaped with were no longer his friends, they were never his friends to begin with, even so the truth was that they had separated years ago, each had their own desires; deceitful desires.
They were cursed beings. Even though they all enjoyed life, Alistair knew the close truth about the Spark, the others never liked his theories. They liked to live and do as they pleased, they forgot that perhaps they were not mistakes, there was a reason for their existence, it had to be part of the Clocked system of the universe. But the others never bothered to research into it, they had their own desires but so did he. Theirs were focussed on the millions of Sparks on Earth, waiting to be devoured keeping them alive. They were heartless and ruthless.
"Guess we are a team," Alistair said with slight sarcasm.
"No, we are not a team. You are my servant, I am your master," Ner placed his hands in his pockets. “A team implies equal partnership, you are not my equal.”
Alistair felt annoyed by the statement, even though it was true. The only way to escape from Death and his Son was to stay hidden and keep running. A coward way of survival, the only survival against Death. He wondered if his so called friends could possibly defeat him, they had been hunting violently and eagerly. He had read countless events on the newspaper and the Raines news channel of the murders. They continued to kill without mercy, perhaps together they could defeat the Son of Death, but it seemed as this Son of Death hadn’t been told the truth of the number of the four undead.
"What will you have me do, Master?" Alistair said ironically.
"I believe you will invite me to your home. And then keep to the agreement we have made." Ner said hardly noticing the sarcasm.
Ner snapped his fingers and everything returned to normal present time. Emma stood in the far corner, both her and her grandfather had a look of confusion. They frowned, then spoke at the same time, then their eyes looked around trying to retrieve the lost celebrity that was standing in front of them.
Alistair glanced at Emma, his heart bloomed in spite of being tortured by the Son of Death. He took in a breath and walked towards Emma.
"Oh dear, what happened to you Alistair?" Emma asked, her eyes wide with surprise at his appearance.
His hair was in a dishevelled mess, buttons lost on his white suit and his black shirt creased and parted in front. Alistair smiled as he thought that it was too bad clothes did not heal themselves.
"I found a friend." Alistair said, pointing towards his new master.
"Ner?" Emma and her grandfather both said shocked.
Alistair groaned, even though he tried to hide it. They knew Ner? They knew the grim Son of Death. The one who had a noose around his neck, pulling the noose as some sort of rein. The one who forced him to use call him master. He groaned again.
Emma knew this frightful being, but how? Questions roamed in his mind wondering, thinking trying to make sense of this peculiar relationship. Was it fate that brought her here or was it the Son of Death?
"Emma. Mr Mathews." Ner said.
"Ner, you know Alistair?" Mr Mathews asked.
"My father knew his, we have been close since we were children," Alistair said easily, it made him ill that he even made them childhood friends.
Mr Mathews nodded in understanding but Emma frowned. She knew something was not quite right. Alistair could tell by the way her eyes slanted to the side. How much did she really know?
"Oh, Ner that is why you wanted to know if any important people were coming to the gallery, you wanted to surprise an old friend, or should I say a young friend." Mr Mathews said cheerfully, then walked to Ner and patted him on the shoulder, as if he had done a good job.
"I never knew you had friends in such high places Ner." Mr Mathews carried on smiling.
"You’d be surprised," Alistair said, watching the interaction.
"Ha ha ha." Mr Mathews smiled a larger smile. Ever since they had found Ner, his dreams were coming true one by one. Ner was a good luck charm besides his dismal expressions, Evans thought.
"Shall we all continue the tour, together?" Evans said still smiling at his good fortune. Ner nodded, Alistair sighed yet politely agreed. Emma remained silent taking the arm of her grandfather and they proceeded to walk to the next painting. They reached the painting, it had large rectangular shapes like skyscrapers then miniature and green circles that stood in midair above the rectangles.
"Your thoughts Emma?" Evans asked staring intently at the picture.
"Sum of 45." She replied softly.
"Alistair?’ Evans asked.
"The city, it seems as though the green circles are life. Gods bring life into the city.’ Alistair said with his head slightly slanting.
"Ah.’ Mr Mathews echoed, trying to see what Alistair saw. Then he blinked and called out Ner’s name for the image he saw.
"A sacrifice, people are carrying their children towards the edge of the world, for the prosperity of green fields.’ Ner grimly replied his words.
"A sacrifice?” Alistair said taken aback by Ner’s words, “That my childhood friend, is not a sacrifice.” Alistair said, upset at Ner’s description.
Ner retorted, “It is hardly the skyscrapers you claim to see."
This brought both of them to stare at each other in hatred. "Well, we cannot all see what the other does. Isn’t that the beauty of art?" Mr Mathews stated, “All I see are shapes.” Evans continued smiling lightly.
"And all I see is numbers, granddad." Emma joined her smile with his.
Ner and Alistair both looked in front of them, once again facing the painting. It was all shapes after all, both of them saw the simplicity in the artwork, of what it truly was. Nothing but shapes, they had enforced their opinion on what they desired to see, that they failed to realise what the artwork really was. Their eyes scrolled to the bottom of the title.
‘Beyond Imaginations’
"I think I should leave, I don’t want to arrive home late." Mr Mathews interrupted their observations.
"I could drive you," Alistair offered.
 “Drive me to the station then, Alistair.”


Chapter 6
‘Daytime claims, night time stole all the interest’

“I’d invite you in, if you were an honoured guest.” Alistair said bothered.
“But I am an honoured guest. Time invites me anywhere and everywhere,” Ner entered through the door, walking in as if he was indeed an honoured guest.
Alistair rejoined, “Fortunately, I am not Time,”
“If you were, balance would exist. How unfortunate you are not,” Ner retorted.
Alistair stood still, grasping angrily on the silver door handle as he watched Ner walk into his home, looking dully smug. He noticed that Emma walked closely to almost every object in his house, fascinated by their contents.
She had asked questions after her grandfather had left, on the real truth, and Ner had calmly told her everything. She looked surprised that Alistair was a Vampire, she never would have guessed it, she exclaimed, to Alistair’s relief, she was not in the least bit disgusted. He closed the door and realised he had forgotten about his prey, his meal, Wyatte Brown. He’d have to find Wyatte at his home later tonight otherwise his body would continue to feel the pressures of rotting. Wyatte Brown was not your average innocent busy body, he was your average murderer and was very busy delighting in their deaths. He had seen Wyatte Brown kill young women, he would usually choose the blondes who were shy and gullible. Alistair needed to stop this. 
He felt obligated, he thought himself as a patriot of justice and Esther would expect this of him. She was righteous, her dream was to enforce the ethics of the justice system. He would murder Wyatte Brown and feel no remorse, he deserved his Spark to be taken away.
He did not even deserve a Spark.
Alistair had been sucking the Spark of many criminals in the city, he found them, bribed some, and always killed them. He was not a bit ashamed of it, why should he be? These humans had no right to live in this world if all they caused were harm to another life. He did it for justice making the city a better place.
“You have a wonderful home,” Emma said, staring at a large vase in the corner.
“Luxury at another’s expense,” Ner said, sitting on the leather couch.
Alistair muttered, “It’s always on another’s expense.” He found his table where he kept his bottle of whiskey.
“Why do you need to bring her?” asked Alistair, pouring himself a glass. Ner did not bother to turn and face him to speculate on Alistair’s expression.
Ner replied, “She is my helper.” He sank his body into the sofa.
Helper? Alistair thought, what exactly did that mean? Was it possible that she was chosen for the purpose to find him, her features were exactly like Esther. Was this a trick? Did this Ner know of his past and what it lacked?
“You need to tell me of the other three,” Ner said, interrupting Alistair’s thoughts. Emma moved from the vase and found herself a seat next to Ner. She sat with her bag on her lap, staring past the broad window displaying the rest of the city. Alistair flared his nostrils as something tugged at his heart when she sat near Ner.
“Drink, Emma?” Alistair offered, lifting his glass towards her.
She shook her head.
“Tea, coffee?” He offered instead.
“Tea would be great. Thanks.”
“I’d have tea too.” Ner added.
“I never offered you, Ner.” Alistair muttered under his breath.
He held his glass of whiskey, drinking it in one gulp, then quickly placed it on the table. He felt the numbness in his chest as he walked to the open area kitchen, switching the kettle on. He truly felt like a servant in his own house. The master and servant conversation between him and Ner back at the gallery seemed to be coming true. He groaned as he made Ner's tea. 
What’s next, he wondered.
“The three rotting abominations, as you are so fond of calling us,” Alistair said, waiting for the kettle to boil, “are a Ghoul, a Rapture, and a Zoliq.” Alistair knew that these were the types of undead beings that he had encountered, he was unsure if there were other types.
He watched as Ner whispered something into Emma’s ear, and that interaction made Alistair’s eyes turn an angry violet. Indeed she could not possibly know who he was, but he knew who she was and who she would become. She was his, not Ner’s little helper. He let out a sigh, watching Emma remove a book from her bag. She opened the empty book and began to write.
“Who is the most dangerous?” Ner asked.
Alistair responded, “Most dangerous? They are all dangerous. But perhaps the one who should definitely die, he should be taken first, is known as the Zoliq,”
The kettle steamed a whistling tune and the button switched off. Alistair opened the top cupboards and withdrew two cups. The only tea he had was black tea, he was more of a coffee fan, rather than tea. Tea had all these health options and antioxidants that he thought were a made up scam, yet still, he had black tea in his cupboard. He thought she would be a coffee person like him. He remembered the past - Esther and him staying awake, drinking coffee with a shot of whiskey, keeping warm, and eventually that would lead to them falling into each other’s arms, the coffee and whiskey warmth would fade as their bodies would embrace.
He heard Emma tapping her pen on her note book and his memory faded.
“What’s a Zoliq?” Emma’s rich voice vibrated through his ears. Alistair smiled.
“A Zoliq, well in Earth terms to describe him," Alistair paused, gathering his words, "is like a zombie, but instead of being slow and dumb, he is quite smart. Even with his intellect his emotions take over, he is a very emotional being. His emotions are sporadic, anything can trigger his anger - his sadness, his happiness. When he doesn't need a Spark, he is kind, a little too nurturing. Well, he is more than your average nice guy, until the Spark begins to fade.”
“Nice guy? I thought all undead beings were evil and heartless,” Emma said, thinking about Ner’s description of all the undead abominations.
“Emma, I am nice. The person that you seem to be describing, is the one sitting next to you,” Alistair said.
The comment made Emma laugh. Ner did not care, he just sat oblivious to the comment, enjoying the leather sofa. It reminded him of his father’s chair. Leather and black, hard and authoritative.
“You are nice, and funny, Alistair,” she said, smiling after her laughter had faded. Alistair was a Vampire? Unbelievable, she thought. He was one of the richest men in the city, he was charming and funny yet he was a Vampire. Unbelievable! She thought again. He resembled a human perfectly, but she could not get past the fact he was a Vampire. He seemed normal, friendly and he made tea! He offered to make tea for both Ner and Emma, he was everything that a normal human should be and more! 
Then she thought, he was charming and friendly so that it was easier to suck peoples' Sparks dry. Careful Emma, she thought to herself.
“Let’s get back to the Zoliq,” Ner said. “I need to understand this Zoliq in order to defeat him.”
“I lived with him for a little while. He was kind and understanding at first, but when we both discovered his exact need for the Spark, we parted ways. I’ve witnessed the good side, but more particularly his bad side. When his Spark begins to fade he gets desperate. He changes into something more sinister.” Alistair placed the teabags in the cups as he spoke, “His anger is heightened, the desperation in his eyes, the need. It’s like an addiction. A sinister addiction that cannot be stopped.”
“What exactly does that mean?” Emma asked.
“He changes into something other than his usual self.” Alistair responded, not willing to explain further.
“I believe you’re circling around your previous sentence. Tell us what he changes to,” Ner said, waiting for the truth.
“He becomes dark, cold, and a monster that no one would want around their children,” Alistair said as he brought a tray with cups of tea and sugar on the side. He placed the tray on the glass table in front of them. He sat down near Emma, staring at her notepad. He noticed that her handwriting was untidy, and smiled.
“No one would want any undead beings around adults or children.” Ner said, slightly irritated.
“Well, that may be true. This Zoliq is one that needs to be kept away from children, he has a fetish for the younger ones,” Alistair said, folding his arms and sinking into his couch.
“Young children? That’s disturbing.” Emma said, feeling unnerved by the mention of a fetish for children.
“He is cursed that way. Being undead has consequences. You eventually find that your prey has to be specific, he has tried to feed on the adults but it did not work out, for some reason the Sparks he needs in order to survive are children.” 
Alistair remembered the first time his friend had hungered, ripping men and women apart. Their limbs would be torn from their bodies as he searched for their Spark. Even when he reached it he would scream with pain when the Spark had no effect, then he found the little boy and Alistair had tried to stop him but his friend was too strong, the hunger inside him had created an unstoppable monster. He was a being wild with need and anything in his way would be trampled.
Emma was curious about what Alistair meant. She wanted to know the meaning behind these undead beings, why they existed, why they were created, how they fed on humans. She was surprised that she wanted to know more, she was surprised that Alistair was a Vampire. She did not know the exact details of the compromise he had with Ner but she knew he would have to die eventually.
“What exactly do undead beings need to survive? The Spark?” Emma asked, eager for the answer.
“Emma, everyone has something within them that created life. The problem with us is that we have already died and were revived. Our Spark needs a constant replacement. Our Spark fades within three months and we need a new one. We need a new Spark to survive,” Alistair said.
“The essence of it is that they kill humans, take their lives so they can carry on living.” Ner’s said blandly.
“I believe you do the same, Ner.” Alistair frowned, feeling as though he had been punched in the gut.
Ner corrected Alistair, “No, I take lives to balance the Earth and the universe's existence.”
“Balance? Even on Earth there are those who do not deserve to live,” Alistair said defensively. “What of the criminals?” He protested, thinking of Wyatte Brown and the criminal who killed Esther. They never deserved to live.
“Everyone deserves a chance at their own life, and that Spark is not yours to take even if it is a criminal,” Ner said, remembering the strict laws and policies of the Council.
“The criminals who kill others, ensuring that the innocent lives and Spark fades. An innocent Spark that could have made a difference in the world we live in today. They could have experienced the life, experienced happiness!” Alistair stood up, angered. Esther had died in the same way, her innocent life taken away by a murderer.
“Ner, you do not understand this world. Its people. You say balance but you don’t know the true meaning of balance. You have no idea what it feels like.”
Ner sat watching Alistair. He did not stand up.
“Everyone is not as innocent as you presume. Every living being has committed sins,” Ner said calmly. “Even those criminals who kill and even those you deem are innocent, the Clock has had it set. Even the destruction of innocent lives is recorded in the Clock. Your social regard for the lives of humanity in this world is very narrow-minded. The Sparks are judged according to their actions.”
Alistair was silent. Narrow-minded? Maybe he was, weren’t humans meant to focus on the good in humanity, keeping innocents alive, it was their law. Why did Esther need to die? It wasn’t her fault, she was innocent! This Son of Death could not understand the law, culture and feelings of Earth, people, and most importantly, him.
Emma saw the frustration in Alistair, he looked saddened as he turned his head and walked towards the window staring into the night.
“I don’t think it is right for criminals to murder innocent people, they should be stopped.” Emma said.
Ner turned his head to his side, he stared at her and spoke. “Emma, this man, this abomination, is a criminal. I am here to stop him.”
Alistair felt a sharp pain tug at his heart. He was a criminal, a murderer. He had killed many innocent lives over the years. He never regarded the moral path when he first arrived in undead fashion. He killed willingly, anyone would do. He was selfish, he was angry, he hated everything when he had lost Esther. It was a curse to be revived, if he had died and his natural Spark gone when he was 88 years, it would have ended his pain and anguish, but he had revived. He woke up with all his memories of her, the pain was relived and he had felt it more intensely. He woke up to everything he had lost, unable to see her. He hated the world, he hated the universe for allowing this, so he saw every human as walking Sparks, walking lives for him to take. Only recently, in his third year of his Vampire life had he realised that each of them had a purpose, each of them had dreams, each of them had families, each and everyone who contained Sparks had importance in this world, no matter how small. Everyone who obtained a Spark deserved to live until Death took them. 
Esther would have not wanted him to murder all those innocent lives, yet he was so lost in his hatred. But he thought there must have been some reward for finding out the truth, there must be some sort of favourable grace once he had realised murdering anyone was wrong.
There must be a reprieve, he thought. When he had found Emma. Emma, his reprieve, yet even reprieves are just delays in punishment.
There was a heavy silence in the air after Ner spoke. It lingered for a few minutes, Alistair still staring over the city. Emma seated near Ner, waiting for the silence to past. Hoping someone would break the grave atmosphere and then Ner spoke breaking the silence.
“Where will we find him? This Zoliq? In schools? In parks?” Ner asked changing the topic. Ner accepted others opinions, he had been doing it for years with the Council members, they had a difference in opinion all the time but the conflict led to the vote and a decision would be decided and he would act on the decision made.
He had a mission, he had no time to dwell in human feelings and social issues that he could not change, nor was he willing to change. After finding those three undead beings, he would send them off to their rightful place then he would do the same for Alistair.
“A quiet neighbourhood near a park,” Alistair spoke, “His name is Henry Dale, last time I saw him he lived in the Gaven suburb. He probably still does, I’m sure he is still in the phonebook.”
Alistair stared dimly at his reflection in the window.
“Henry Dale,” Emma whispered.

***

Henry Dale stood near the bed of young Daniel, he stood silently watching him sleep. He could easily see in the dark, it was one of the perks of being undead, one of the advantages of hunting the innocent. He stared at Daniel’s breathing pattern. The rise and fall of the calming dreaming chest. The youthful forgotten fears hidden, lost in a gleeful dream. Henry stood like a shadow, a part of the dark. His footsteps silent as the quiet night walking towards the sleeping head of Daniel.
He stopped, his eyes turning to the little boy’s face. He resembled someone he knew, someone important yet he could not remember. His body ached within, the Spark was fading, his veins and blood were rotting, being dehydrated, turning a dull grey. His heart started to beat slowly as if it was thickening to hardened clay, his breathing accelerated as he tried grasping for air from his mouth into his lungs. 
He would need to devour soon.
His silver eyes grew a golden red in the dark, the new eyes leered at his prey, he needed to feed, he needed the boy, he needed the Spark. He had tried to resist the urge to feed, tried to fight it as soon as he realised only the Sparks of children would allow him to continue to live, yet even though he attempted with vigour to resist, tried to combat the urge, he had constantly failed miserably.
“Fallen leaves, red and brown, autumn sprouts, a tune in doubt,” Henry began whispering the haunting song he had remembered from his past. The past life he lived, he tried to remember who he was, it was fading, his memories were being forgotten. He was forgetting himself, forgetting where he was from, he was slowly forgetting everything that he was. 
"Kaylee," he whispered, unsure where the name was from but it was important.
He gripped his head, trying to remember. "Kaylee," he said again, more firmly. An image of a young girl appeared in his mind, but it was blurry. He could not remember or clearly see the image. He sighed in pain as he realised his personality was changing, even though he could not quite recall the personality he had, he did not recognise himself. He could faintly remember he had a wife, three, or was it one child? Yet he could not materialise their names. "Kaylee," his mouth uttered again. He tried to identify if she was his child, but he could not remember her face. The image was a blur. He knew her, he knew Kaylee, he knew he had a family, yet he could not picture them in his mind, his mind failed to remember them. His memories of a family were faint yet however faint he could not trust if they were true.
He moved his hand towards his chest, feeling something hidden in his front pocket. He lifted the object from his pocket, it was a photograph. There were three children and one woman, smiling brightly. A vacation photograph, he thought. They were near the seaside. Was this his family? Was this his wife? He thought she had blonde hair but here in this photograph her hair was black. He thought she wore yellow sunlit dresses but the photograph said otherwise. She wore pants and a sporty jacket. Was this really his wife? Were these his children? He examined the picture more clearly, trying to picture himself with them, trying to stare long enough to catch a letter or syllable of their names. The sudden image of the girl named Kaylee appeared in his mind. "Kaylee, Kaylee, Kaylee." He whispered over and over again, urging his mind to remember, to recall this important person to him.
It was no use, his eyes stared blankly and his mind failed to recall anything. He turned the photograph around, and found a memento scribbled sentence. Was this his handwriting? He read the font.
Sarah and kids. Ralph the husband/photographer.
Sarah. Ralph. He was not Ralph, he was Henry. This was not his family. Why was this photograph in his pocket? Who were these people? Maybe they resembled his family? He felt saddened, the pain seeped in, he had a family… he had forgotten. 
"Kaylee." he softly whispered, saddened with loss.
He tossed the photograph on the bed, clearing his thoughts. He resumed watching the boy slumber. He could see the glow, the Spark within the young boy’s body. It was the purest, whitest light. Gleaming, sparkling, asking, even pleading to be taken. He could see in the dark, he could see the Spark in any human’s body. He began to lick his lips as the light drew his senses within the small body. He had to have it, he felt the need arise, the hunger within was tempting him it was stronger than ever, he would have it, there was no question about it.
He lifted the blankets from the small body, the photograph fell to the ground. Henry placed his hand on the boy’s mouth and nose, his eyes illuminated with golden need. He tightened his grip on the boy’s face, suffocating him. The suffocation would place him in an unconscious state, not immediately killing him. The boy squirmed at first, but as he felt the lack of air in his lungs he  sprung open his eyes, first confused, then panic convulsed his body as he failed to breathe. He struggled, his limbs trying to fight, yet he could not, he was not as powerful as the monster who forced him into an unconscious slumber. The boy closed his eyes, still having a faint pulse, his heart distant, but still beating.
Then the monster known as Henry Dale began to feed on the limbs, each bone and vein he passed was leading him to the white light. He needed it, it was hypnotising him, he knew he needed to find the Spark to survive.
After he retrieved the Spark, the boy lay lifeless on the bed. Henry held him in his arms, blood oozing and dripping down on to the carpet. The blood stained the blankets, it stained the boy, it stained Henry’s memories, but mostly it stained Henry. The boy’s blood kept dripping, his life, his Spark already gone yet the blood would not stop flowing. The smell began to nauseate Henry, but he could not leave, he could not let go of the young boy’s body.
"Kaylee," he whispered again, remembering her. She wore a small, white dress. She had blonde hair like her mother. "Kaylee," he cried out in a whisper, finally remembering his daughter. 
He stood holding the small body of Daniel and felt the deep regret, the emotions of guilt pounding against his chest and body. The action he had taken and needed, the time forgotten. The life he wished, the life he hungered. The life he held that had faded.
The child he cherished, the priceless life he had lost.
Everything that seemed logical appeared in his emotional regret, the sin he committed that he could never be forgiven for, he knew it was wrong. He remembered Kaylee telling him this was wrong. He shoved away the image. He had lived a moral life before all of this, before he had revived into this cursed being. But he questioned if he ever did live such a life? He felt he did but he was not certain, the boy’s body in his hands convinced him he never had.
What was happening to him, over the last past years, his memory was fading, all the small lives he had taken were forgotten even though he recalled that he would remember everyone, he would ask each of them to forgive him. He would? Did he really say that? 
He laid the boy on the carpet floor, the photograph glaring at him as it lay near the body. He picked up the photograph and placed it once again in his pocket. His body felt the Spark ignite, providing him with life again. His heart functioned properly beating at the correct interval.
Yet even though he felt the relief he felt the guilt more. Every time he murdered he was turning into the monster that he was. His faded youth still remained, yet the aging memories forgotten. At times they would come back to him in scattered images, every one of them tormenting him. They were nightmares he was forgetting. He had forced himself to forget, yet he still wanted to remember. Remember what exactly?
"Kaylee," his mouth answered. He did not want to forget Kaylee, his precious daughter. But he was what he was, he would continue to do what he always did. He could not resist the life, the taking of another life to survive. 
Survival.
He thought he would never need it. He thought that everyone had a right to a life being lived and taking a Spark of another was a sinful life, one that deserved death, yet that sinful life he was disgusted by had become his life. He had seen past the light fallen to the dark and the light where he thought would never leave had rejected him. He stared at the dead child, the stillness of the child, the lifeless form without a soul. 
His eyes glistened with tears. 
Even in the shadowed darkness that he was currently apart of, the only light was the regretful tears that fell mixing with the blood. He felt the emotions, he always felt more than the other undead, this time he felt the heartache of sadness, hunger and fear. He whimpered as he knelt down near the dead body, touching the head of the blonde boy, caressing him tenderly. He whispered continuing his song,
“The autumn leaves fell, yet no one could tell.”
As he sang he realised that he could not let go of the life he did not even want.

Chapter 7
'Deals, contracts always need approval of both parties'

“Here’s the phonebook,” Alistair said holding the green book in his hands, he offered it to Emma.
“You have a phonebook?” She sounded surprised.
“Everyone has a phone book in their homes. It’s mandatory,” Alistair said, feeling foolish for having a phonebook. What was exactly wrong with having a phonebook? In the many years he had lived on Earth before his death and even so after his death the green phone books had never died. Every human being had one. He had used them millions of times, a page away from a friend, or a leaking roof that needed to be repaired. It was all there perfectly organised in alphabetical order and easily understood.
“Ah, erm, it isn’t really mandatory. My grandfather doesn’t have one.” As she spoke she wondered about the statistics of the population with phonebooks. She recalled an article she had read on the recent decline of the usage of phonebooks. Most of the companies were in the process of declaring bankruptcy, some were already bankrupt. Her mind added Alistair to the less than 30 percent of people who still actually had one.
“I guess it is dependent on one’s perception, what is really deemed necessary in one’s life,” Alistair said, finding an excuse for having a phonebook. Why did she hate phonebooks? There was absolutely nothing wrong with having one, many people were privileged to have one. The green book was always a constant in the Earthly life. Yet, even though his thoughts convinced him all the right and honourable reasons in the defence of the phonebook Emma’s tone and surprise on this subject irritated him.
“What is wrong with having a phonebook?” Alistair spurted out with slight annoyance.
“Ah… nothing really, it’s just that the internet has those search engines including the green phonebook that is now digital. You just type in certain characteristics of what you’re looking for and you can find almost anyone and everything.” Emma replied, taking the phone book from his hands.
“Even undead abominations?” Ner asked.
Alistair winced at Ner’s question; or rather it was his voice or maybe even his presence that made Alistair cringe.
“No.” Alistair answered Ner with a quick snap.
Emma looked up at Alistair, she had opened the green book in search for the suburb and Henry Dale when she heard the angered Alistair. Ner and Alistair were far from friends, their interactions with one another were based on disagreements and hostility, but the one who was angered and hostile was Alistair. Every comment from Ner’s mouth seemed to aggravate Alistair further, but she thought anyone would be hostile if they were forced to aid someone who was bound to kill them after their assistance. Ner on the other hand did not seem to mind, he was always calm and paid no mind to Alistair. Ner was focused on his mission and nothing could stop him from accomplishing what he was required to do. She thought of the two people next to her then sighed quietly as she spoke.
“Undead beings are fictitious. Even the internet would fail to lead you to the right person, it would probably lead you to a wild myth, Atlantis maybe.” She smiled, but none of them shared her humour. “Ah, well the phone book is here with us so we might as well use it. It has the same information as the internet. We would end up using the green phone book website anyway,” She turned to the phone book again, searching for the name Henry Dale.
“The phone book has a dozen Henry Dales and are we definitely sure he is in the same suburb?” Emma asked Alistair, while Ner eyed the Vampire strangely.
Alistair saw the look of suspicion on Ner’s face. They had found the green registered phone book in his home and he suggested the idea, did Ner think that he was lying? The gaze of mistrust made Alistair want to punch Ner square in the face. Why would he mislead them when he too thought of finding Henry? He felt some sort of redemption purpose sprout within his veins.
Henry was a murderer, he killed children, he did not have a choice, but killing pure, innocent beings was disturbing to Alistair. Henry needed to die, and he needed the Son of Death to aid him to do it.
“It’s probably one of them, Henry usually stays put in one place for some time, he doesn’t like change but is very discreet and likeable,” Alistair said as he thought more on Henry’s characteristics. “He’s probably friendly with the neighbourhood, everyone would know him as the nice man who doesn’t have many achievements...”
“Except for killing children,” Ner ended Alistair’s sentence “Probably is not certain, when last did you see him? Years? Months? Possibly a day ago or maybe you are certain you saw him...” Ner paused, “A day ago." Ner finished warning Alistair with his eyes.
Alistair lowered his voice. “Certainty is unpredictable at times.” 
“That definition is for the word 'probably',” Ner said,  “and even if you placed that on certainty the ‘at times’ is much more accurate in predictability than 'probably'.”
Emma listened to the banter between the two of them. As they carried on in the definition of probably and certainty she had an idea.
“Do you know the description of the murdered victims, how they were murdered?” She asked, interrupting Alistair's defence of probably and Ner’s on certainty. Both of them stared at her.
“There must be a specific manner in which Henry murders his victims and if it is every three months, we can follow the trail and figure out his recent whereabouts,” she said, sitting with her arms folded beneath her chest. “It should be plastered on the news and newspapers somewhere, assuming that he has a gruesome method of killing.”
“That seems like a plan,” Ner said, still staring at Alistair. “Well, we better get started on the newspapers, I’ll let you know of the details of how he murders his victims.”
“All we need to find is his recent victim's death, then knock on every door in his neighbourhood. You’ll recognise him Alistair.’ Emma said.
Alistair thought of Emma’s plan and said, “Yes, he’ll know me. More so when we talk about our undead past.”

***

He awoke in a sweat, panting and lips dry. These were one of the symptoms of the fading Spark. He was already dehydrating rapidly, soon he’d fall into a fever then the pain would be unbearable. He needed to feed, he needed Wyatte Brown. He pushed the covers off his body and sat up, wiping the sweat off his brow.
The unexpected meeting with the Son of Death and Emma had caught him off guard. He was more than glad he had found Emma but not so much for the Son of Death. He thought about how exactly they had come to know each other. She did not seem like she was helping him out of fear, it seemed to be something else. Something he was afraid to discover, yet he had to know. Alistair had to find out the true relationship of Ner and Emma. He realised that Emma was in the bedroom across from him, he felt that his heart was eager to see her, so he placed a white loose shirt on and jeans finding his way to Emma’s door.
He quietly opened her door, and found her sleeping. He stood before her, staring at her while she slept peacefully. She was beautiful. His heart tugged. He knelt down, his hand reached for her cheek, caressing her softly.
“Can you believe this?" He asked, smiling as he caressed her cheek, "You are here, Esther. Remember your name is my compass to guide me to you." He traced his fingers against her lips, desiring to kiss her. "Esther, this time we will be together." He smiled, leaning his face closer to hers. He closed his eyes and gently pressed his lips against hers. His heart fluttered as he felt her warm lips against hers. For her he would do anything, he wanted to stay longer in this moment but he lifted his face from hers. He could not believe she was here in his house, sleeping soundly. It was a miracle, it seemed as though everything he was searching for was being found and all he had to do now was finally make it happen. 
"Esther, this time we will be together,” he promised, smiling with hope.
Everything has steps, Alistair reminded himself. The first thing to do was to find Wyatte Brown, and so he left Emma’s room, finding the door to the dark night. 
Ner had witnessed Alistair leave, he was not concerned  where Alistair was going but was curious why Alistair would leave from Emma’s bedroom.

***

Griffin Sullen’s body lay on the cold floor, his face plastered to the white tiles of the basement. His body absorbed the frostiness of the tiles while the floor took his warmth. An unfair exchange, he thought as he started to gain consciousness. His eyes fluttered open but ended up closed again. He tried his best to understand where exactly he was, recalling the images he had seen through his rapid blinking, but his attempt failed when he felt the effects of the dreadful hangover. His head burned with yesterday’s alcohol.
“Bother,” he whispered in the dark, his voice raspy and thirsty. He tried to move his body; a leg, an arm, any limb his brain could possibly control, but his whole body and limbs disappointed him, they failed to respond. So his face and body remained compressed to the ground. Perhaps lying on the floor like an invalid was not a bad idea, he thought. He had nowhere to go, nowhere to be, no one to see. Well, to be honest, maybe he did have someone to see. Someone who he shouldn’t see, but what was life if you could not see the only thing you desired? And the only thing Griffin Sullen desired was a bottle and the taste of liquor on his tongue.
“Bother,” he said again a bit more loudly than a whisper. His head pounded with pain as if his brain desired to flee from his skull, and it kept bumping his skull to find a way out. He was used to drinking alcohol, he drank twice as much as the average man, make that thrice as much. He should be used to the after-effects, the pounding headaches and constant thirst like a cotton ball, always parched. Yet unfortunately he was not, unless you considered it a good thing, an encouraging aspect to force him to quit, but how could you quit the only thing you really loved? He thought to himself as his brain settled down a bit, probably realising there was no escape to the prison called the skull.
He felt his senses come back to him after the long self-reflection, he raised his leg up then down then up again, then down again, deciding to attempt to crawl with his eyes closed. He thought, if he could find the edge of the room, reach a wall that would assist him in standing on his clumsy feet, he would thank the wall with a bottle of scotch or maybe brandy preferably the latter, the wall wouldn’t mind. He lifted his arms in front of his face whilst still on the ground, he tried to push his upper body forward.
Success!
He was moving, very slowly, but still moving. Didn’t they say first you crawl then stand, then take your first step then run and win a marathon? A marathon? Really, Grif? A marathon? He thought to himself in disbelief, his mind had a way of making positivity reach the peak of unrealistic fact, that made the positivity a rather mocking phrase.
“Uh, uh,” He panted as he crawled inches away from his original position, eager to accomplish a hand shake with the wall, but his achievement was shortly lived when he heard foreign footsteps and whispers, growing louder as they progressed towards him.
“Bother,” again he whispered. He was tired, slightly groggy, and he was thirsty. He had no time for unfamiliar guests in his room, it was not his room but no one else seemed to be occupying it, so he might as well deem it his.
He tried to recall the events of yesterday, how he had come to this unfortunate place. He continued to crawl as he contemplated, hearing the footsteps and voices grow louder. Then the memory of yesterday appeared in front of him as his hands felt the brick wall. The rough texture and dents of the bricked wall would make it easier for him to grasp and finally stand up. The footsteps stopped and the voices quietened, there was an alarming silence that surrounded him. He needed to get up, snap out of the grogginess and find the hunting spirit.
He heard the door open slowly, footsteps entered the room. With all the effort he thought he had of survival, his body had once again disappointed him. It remained lying pathetically on the floor, at least his fingertips were holding the brick wall.
He took in a sigh, whispering the word 'bother' in his head. Maybe he could pretend to be dead, another passing body, lifeless and ready for burial. He removed his hand from the brick wall and placed it beside his body. Still as a brick, he thought in crude humour.
Alistair, Ner, and Emma had reached the final stair below, and they continued to walk through the bricked hallway. There was a light above them swaying to and fro, attached on a lengthy white wire, providing light at intervals in the hallway.
Alistair and Ner walked in front, side by side, while Emma walked cautiously behind. They saw a basement door made of wood with a silver key in the opening. Basements were creepy, Emma thought. In horror movies that her mother fondly loved, they always contained dead bodies or awful secrets that were meant to be kept secret and hidden in basements forever. She was surprised the lower floor was made of tiles, usually they were wooden in an old house like this. She recalled a movie of a mad scientist who experimented on people in the basement, he had tiles, white tiles like Henry Dale’s. She felt her hair behind her neck rise.
“This is creepy,” Emma said, frightened, shuddering as she spoke.
“You shouldn’t have come. Courage and boldness said in fear never help, they always leave one dead,” Alistair advised.
Alistair was upset that she was eager to come and assist in the search for Henry. It seemed as though she had no regard for her own life, she had aided enough with her numbers and intelligence, but this was different, this was about trapping and killing an undead being. She had no experience in the matter, she did not know how to kill, she had no idea of the power of the undead or even Ner, more so Henry.
Henry would be in his state of desperate survival when he realised he was being cornered and when one was trapped, especially the undead they used the weak link in the opponents party, the first one they could easily rip apart in seconds, in this case that was Emma.
“That’s true,” Ner agreed. He could smell the dust from the bricks, some had fallen to the tiles, lying at the edges of the wall. “Courage and boldness should be expressed in the right situations,” Ner continued.
“Situations you are likely to win.” Alistair carried on Ner’s sentence. 
“Even if you are not likely to win, at least do it fearlessly,” Ner said.
Emma folded her arms as she heard them talk, they were finishing each other’s sentences! Unbelievable, they hated each other, Ner was going to kill Alistair eventually! This was unbelievable to her eyes and ears, her fear dissipated despite their interaction infuriating her.
Alistair took hold of the key and turned it to the right, It made a clicking sound, the door was now unlocked. He opened the door cautiously, peeking through the darkened room, then stepped forward. He saw a body lying near the wall. The body did not move, it remained stony still as if dead. Alistair could see in the dark, but instead of the colour one would see in the daylight, in the dark he saw different shades of grey. This time the body was a lighter grey than the overall room, the size and shape of the body seemed to fit a tall man. He wondered if Ner could see the same body in the dark. If not this would be an advantage he had over Ner. He glanced at Ner, already gliding towards the dead body in the dark. Alistair realised he had no advantage, he was currently still at the disadvantage.
“Where are the lights?” Griffin heard a female voice.
“Should be around the wall.” This was a male voice, a familiar male voice.
He heard footsteps moving towards the room. Was this the third person? He had heard two, but the voices seemed very far compared to the footsteps. Griffin attempted to open his eyes slightly, it was pitch black. He could not see much because of the position of his body, but his eyes were getting accustomed to the darkness, then surprisingly the lights turned on and he groaned loudly. His eyes felt as if he was blinded and his head throbbed, a switch of death, he thought, like the electric chair.
He turned his body involuntarily as he groaned, rubbing his eyes, then he found himself seated with his back leaning against the wall. He continued to rub his eyes not eager to view the people who were probably going to:
Number 1. Kill him;
Number 2. Report him to the police;
And finally, Number 3. Kill him.
“Can’t anyone get some decent sleep around here?” Griffin asked, pretending to be annoyed that someone had woke him.
“For decent sleep, you need a bed.” This was the familiar male voice he recognised yet could not place.
He finished rubbing his eyes and looked up at the faces of his soon to be murderers. His eyes felt bloodshot red and slightly sore as he tried to look sober. He first noticed the female, she stood near the light switch, she was the cause of his throbbing headache. She looked nerdy, her dull brown hair tied in a ponytail, her red glasses too big for her face, her green sweater baggy, making her look fatter than she was, but at least her brown jeans fit her perfectly. Her colour choice was so awful that even the light from the bulb was less painful then staring at her dress sense.
He moved to the next person, and his eyes drew into a frown of confusion, he recognised the man in front of him, he knew that voice more importantly he knew that sarcasm.
“Alistair, good friend! It's been ages,” Griffin said, relieved it was Alistair who stood before him, yet he was wondering what exactly Alistair was doing here in this basement. They had separated years back, Alistair had left first with his theories of Sparks. Was he searching for something important in relation to the Sparks?
“Griffin Sullen, what are you doing in this basement?” Alistair asked, yet this is what Griffin wanted to ask Alistair. Alistair had known Griffin since becoming undead and even before the undead occurrence. They had not been friends until the undead situation where they shared in much alcohol and random, humorous talk. But even though Alistair had enjoyed Griffin’s company, Griffin was addicted to the fermented fruit and would not be separated from it.
Griffin had listened to all that Alistair said, Alistair’s theories of Sparks and their existence yet he could never really bother with the rules Alistair had invented that came along with the theories.
“Here to sleep,” Griffin slightly grinned, “But what a happy reunion, what did we use to call you back in the good old days?” Griffin asked, “Honourable Al,” he answered his own question.
“Sleeping in a basement?” Alistair questioned sarcastically, “No better place like the pavement floor?”
“Honourable Al, help me up would you?” Griffin asked ignoring Alistair’s taunt and lifted his hand towards Alistair, waiting for assistance.
Alistair folded his hands, one of his eyebrows arched as he stared down at Griffin.
“Not so honourable anymore, Al? I can understand how the world has changed you, it sure has tempted me with other exploits. But you can never really leave the love of the first exploit, it captures you like your first love,” Griffin said, moving his hand down on the tiles and then positioning himself comfortably against the wall. “Well, if you are not gonna speak about exploits, let’s move to other topics, like who might be your companions?” Griffin’s eyes shifted from Alistair’s face and moved to the next male presence.
He was stunned at the person his eyes scrutinised, he felt a slight shudder when speaking to Alistair but he did not realise the cause of it was from the aura of the Son of Death. His mind tried to tell him it was the after-effects of the alcohol, yet his body knew the chilling jitter was caused by the dark presence of Death, or rather Death’s son. What was Alistair doing with the Son of Death? Ner Relc Alcott they called him, the rumours said he was ruthless, merciless, frightening, and all other synonyms alike.
“Alistair, you seem to be in a deeper pit than me,” Griffin said, looking back at Alistair. Alistair knew the meaning to that, Griffin actually said, you’re an idiot. 
“You’ve cooped up with Death, or rather the miniature version of him. That’s strange, wouldn’t you say?” Griffin continued and Alistair interpreted, once again you’re an idiot, leave me out of this.
“Wasn’t one of your rules that we, the undead, should flee from Death, not be one of his companions, at least attempt to walk away, Alistair,” Griffin said, smirking. Alistair examined his words to mean, run, you idiot or was it let me run, you idiot. Alistair wondered why he kept interpreting idiot in the sentences, he realised he was really disclosing his own deep thoughts as Griffin spoke, the main fact was he was an idiot, and was still an idiot.
He was caught up in fancy fantasies, a battle he was unable to win, the impossibilities of the possible that he thought about, would they really be fulfilled? Could he really survive against Ner? Could he find a way to live? Could he find a way to gain Esther? Could he find away to live on with Esther as his companion, and eventually would he be able to become human again, a true human with his own Spark? His thoughts faded as he heard Ner’s voice.
“Miniature Death? Interesting deduction,” said Ner. “And which undead abomination are you?” Ner had a book in his hand with a blue cover.
“Captain Griffin Sullen. Vampire, fornicator, drinker, gambler, to name just a few attributes,” Griffin said, “though I prefer the last two descriptions.” He smiled.
Ner was not smiling with him, his eyes were not even looking at the pile of junk on the wall.
“Drinker and gambler.” Ner paged his book, “Alistair, which friend of yours is this?”
Griffin eyed Alistair wondering if indeed Alistair would answer the Son of Death. And when Alistair did, Griffin chuckled.
“Another Vampire.”
A second Vampire? Ner began to wonder how many undead beings were actually living on Earth. He could probably kill this one after he got hold of the information needed. If there were more Vampires, that would mean there would be more Raptures, Zoliqs and Ghouls. It seemed as though the four types, Raptures, Zoliqs, Vampires and Ghouls were a type of race like the human race. 
Emma walked forward, eyeing the undead being who was, or still seemed to be, close friends with Alistair.
“Well, what do we have here? A girl in the midst of demons.” He wondered why she looked familiar when she drew closer.
“How did you get here?” Ner asked, ignoring Griffin’s banter.
Griffin said nothing, not willing to speak to someone who was likely to kill him.
“Answer him, Grif,” Alistair coerced.
Griffin chuckled. “Al, how you’ve changed since the last I saw you. I always found it humorous that the curse allowed you to take the Sparks of both genders while I happen to get solely males, even though I do not swing that way, I assure you.”
“We are looking for Henry,” Alistair said getting straight to the point, “You’re in his house, how exactly did you get here?”
Alistair’s question forced Griffin to recall the activities of yesterday and he just then realised how miserable and pathetic they had turned out.
“Well, I’d speak, and you know Al, I do enjoy speeches,” Griffin said, “But of course before my words of value are open to the public, I would have the same strange deal you have with, perhaps my future miniature boss, Death.”


Chapter 8
'...reunion'

The second Vampire seemed to be worse than the first, Ner thought, as he read the last word of his blue book. At least compared with the first Vampire, from Ner’s observations and limited conversations he had had with Alistair. He had noticed that Alistair had an honour complexity that allowed Ner to easily control him, but not this one who lay on the floor. Ner glanced across the room to where Griffin’s body lay. Griffin met his gaze and smiled back, his teeth glistening yellow with plaque. This second Vampire was a wild card, Ner thought. How did the book on chaos describe the term, ‘an object or character that is linked to various ideologies but never bound by any, an example would be water, without the scientific characteristics of water.’
Ner recalled how Griffin had described himself, a variety of words just like the wild card term, water that shifts and changes shape. First he had stated he was a Captain. A soldier? Or more like a drunken sailor. Ner could not trust the words of this second Vampire, he was always smirking and chuckling with something idiotic to say that had no relevance to the current situation yet, he was correct in saying he was a gambler, his negotiation skills were of high risk, he knew he was going to die, yet still wanted to compromise. The book on Vampires that Miss Underwood had given him as a reference was all theory - the researchers had never met a real Vampire.
“A different Vampire with the same deal,” Ner said, closing his book. It dissipated into smoke and disappeared. He walked coolly towards Griffin’s seated body. “I’m not too sure how valuable the information you have is.” Ner stopped two steps from Griffin’s bare footed feet. Griffin’s bloodshot eyes followed Ner’s movement, he felt tense when Ner drew closer towards him, he held his breath in and when Ner stopped. 
Griffin let out his tensed breath. “I was with Henry, he was always a good friend. He lent me more than money,” He passed a side glance to Alistair, “Unlike some, who just bring misfortune.”
“You might have been with Henry Dale but that could have been a year ago,” Ner said, placing one hand in his pocket. “I’ve been warned not to trust drunkards and gamblers.”
Griffin laughed, “I’ve been warning Al to do the same, he took heed to my warning and look where he ended up... with you,” Griffin chuckled out, “What will you do miniature Death?” Griffin asked far too casually, “Will you trust my word?”
Ner moved from his original position to Griffin’s face in an instant, he had summoned a shadowed cloth of black that circled round Griffin’s neck, it turned bright orange then ignited to red as if it was burning steel, “Argh,” Griffin uttered in unexpected pain, his skin on his neck was roasting, he could smell his flesh burn. He closed his eyes trying to shut out and endure the pain, when he opened his eyes, the pain had dissipated but he was more dumbfounded as he found himself somewhere entirely different to the bright lit basement.
“Where am I?” He cried out.
It was pitch black and even with his undead superior eye-sight, this was a darkness that refused to let him see. He blinked, trying to wade through a knee length sludge, it smelled of muddy blood. He walked barefoot through the thick liquid using his hands as a guide to find any visible surface that could aid him. No luck. He kept walking, and walking. It seemed like he was walking for hours and still remained in the same spot.
“I’ll trust you on your word, Griffin Sullen.” Griffin heard Ner’s voice in the dark, it came as a breezy whisper across his ear. “Arghh,” Griffin screamed out loud, he had felt tiny needles pierce through his ear where the breeze had spoken.
“Dammit,” Griffin cursed out, he held his ear as it drenched in blood, his blood dripping down to the sludge near his feet. “What is this place?” He shouted, he could not see anything, “Where am I?” It was silent for a minute, all Griffin could hear was the sludge moving against his feet, then he heard Ner’s voice again, “Slave Territory, this will be your current state of mind,” Ner explained, “You are trapped here in darkness forever, until you disintegrate into the ground, like the people before you. You feel them, don’t you? You’re walking through and on their blood and bones.”
“Would you like some light to see?” Ner asked.
Griffin shuddered as he realised the stench of stale blood was indeed what he was walking through - a mire river of dead people.
“They aren’t dead,” Ner said almost reading Griffin’s thoughts, “Don’t tell me they haven’t been reaching to you for help yet, don't worry, they’ll cry out soon.” As Ner spoke, Griffin felt them. He gulped down the last saliva he had and began to run. Grimy hands trying to grip his feet and legs from within the sludge.
“Join us, we are so, so lonely,” He heard an old man’s voice whisper, but it sounded like three people screaming in pain. The echoes of the word 'lonely' kept bouncing off the darkness. The hands finally found his bare feet and tightly gripped his limbs, forcing him to trip to his knees. Griffin tried his best to kick them off but it seemed as though they were becoming more forceful, like waves. He could not see anything in this darkness, but he felt the slimy hands pull at his legs aggressively.
“Get off me, you aren’t alone!” He screamed, “You are many!” But the hands did not listen, they had tighten their grip on both Griffin's legs and began to drag him deeper into the bloody sludge. Griffin fell on his face as the hands hauled him, he had involuntarily swallowed some of the dreadful liquid in the process. 
“Join us,” they called to him in a whisper. “Join us, join us, join us,” they chanted as they dragged his body deeper into the sinking mud.
This is insane, Griffin thought in a panic. He was being dragged down into some unknown sludgy territory with dead crying souls. Would he become one of them? His heart was beating rapidly as he sank down, deeper into the bloody sludge.
“Son of Death, what will you have me do?” Griffin quickly pleaded, his body being pulled down, deeper into the ground by hands and screeching whispers. “Son of Death!” Griffin cried out in the dark, trying to keep his head submerged above the blood-soaked mud, the hands had now trapped his arms, forcing him to sink with them. “Dammit, Son of Death. I’ll be your slave.” The hands continued to anchor him down, whispering violently for him to join them.
Ner heard Griffin’s covenant and he appeared in front of Griffin’s sinking head. Ner floated above the grimy liquid, he knelt down, lighting his index finger. It lit up, glowing bright white, revealing some of what was in the darkened room - an endless river of body parts.
Ner placed his finger on Griffin’s forehead, branding him a servant. Griffin felt the heat on his head, he was thankful for the burning distraction especially when he was being forced to sink into the remains of random half-dead bodies.
“Lanet, d?r s?lend?,” Ner said, sealing the deal, “Never forget this moment, Griffin Sullen, this is the day you sold your soul to death, you are half the Spark you were and as a servant of death, you no longer require a recharge of Sparks. Be grateful, Griffin Sullen.”
Griffin's heart pounded hard as he woke to the violet burn on his forehead, “Arggh!” He screamed out, opening his eyes. He found Ner’s face staring down at him. “Geez!” He said, alarmed, trying to back away into the bricked wall behind him. “You scared the living daylight out of me,” Griffin said, glad he was back in Henry’s basement. What had happened? Where was the pitch black torturing sinking place? He remembered vividly how Ner had frightened him in order to save him. The son of Death was not one to play games with, Griffin thought.
“Bother,” Griffin said touching his head in pain, “That was worse than a hangover.”
“What are you on about, Grif?” Alistair asked, “You’ve been staring at Ner for less than a second, are you going to tell us about Henry or do we have to torture you into it?” Alistair asked plainly.
Griffin thought on Alistair’s words, torture him again? He looked at Alistair in confusion, then he realised that Alistair and the girl had not known what had occurred. In just less than a second he was tortured by the Son of Death and the barbaric torture felt like hours, but it was less than a second? Time and space were his allies. It was plain scary the worlds Death had access to. The pitch black world where he had agreed to become death’s slave, but what exactly did that mean?
“Henry Dale will be back in three days,” Griffin rubbed his forehead where Ner had branded him. He felt no scar, his skin was smooth, yet he still sensed something heavy on his forehead, weighing him down. “He went to the beach somewhere, requested me to watch over his home.”
Well this was strange, Alistair thought. Why was Griffin so easily agreeable all of a sudden? He seemed to break down in honesty within a few steps of Ner. That alone was odd.
“Three days,” Alistair heard Emma’s voice. “He went on vacation for three days?”
Griffin still touched the invisible spell on his forehead. “Yeah, vacation. We undead buggers enjoy vacations as much as the high school human hooligan does. We all need to get away.” I need to get away, Griffin thought to himself.
“The undead always vacation on earth,” Ner said, not amused that he had to wait another three days to find a Zoliq. While this undead was already vacationing on Earth, he was on another type of vacation within Earth. “Emma, we will be staying here for the next three days until this undead abomination reveals hims –“
 “Emma, I think it would be best if I take you home,” Alistair interrupted, walking towards her, but before he could reach Emma, Griffin finally found enough sobered strength to stand up and use some of his undead vampirish powers. He swept past Alistair and formed a barrier between Alistair and Emma, 
“Emma stays here Al.” Alistair stared at Griffin with surprise, but Griffin was far more shocked than Alistair as he realised what he had done. He would have never bothered to interfere, it seemed as though his body and mind had automatically decided to oppose Alistair and follow Ner’s commands. 
Was this the meaning of being a branded slave until death? You follow an order without really thinking about it? Griffin sighed, wondering if perhaps the slimy, bloodied hands were a better option than isolated slavery, but before he could decide he saw Emma staring at him in hard concentration, as if she recognised him from somewhere. And then it hit him, he did in fact recognise her from somewhere. She continued to observe him, her green eyes assessing his average number. All of Griffin's senses were stunned by the discovery his mind had made, it was more shocking than anything else the son of Death could pull off.
“Esther?” He said perplexed. “Esther.” He repeated the name that had been forgotten on his tongue. “Esther?” He said a third time, remembering all too well.
Esther, he thought, staring into the green eyes of his only sister.
This is what happens when you begin to sober up unnaturally, Griffin said in his head, then it slipped out of his mouth rather loudly, “This is what happens when you sober up unnaturally.”
Alistair gave a warning look to Griffin, indicating that he should tone his vocals to silence, “Another word from your mouth, Grif,” he whispered, “And we will be dead."
“Dead? Dear Al, we are already dead. But the strangest thing of forcefully being made to sober up is the hallucinations. Hallucinations!” He explained, trying to make sense of how his sister was standing in front of him. “I mean, I was on the basement floor a while ago and as soon as I woke up to sober-hood... my eyes witness the Son of Death.” Griffin pointed his hand towards Ner, surprised that his hand knew the exact position where Ner stood. “A lost friend.” Griffin turned his body from Emma in the direction of Alistair.
“All of this must be a hallucination,” he uttered, grabbing Alistair in a bear hug to ensure he was real. “Dammit, Al why won’t you disappear?” He squeezed harder, “Disappear! How long do you want me to hold you until you vanish? Disappear, Al! You're a hallucination!” Alistair’s bones cracked, and he immediately broke free from the gripping embrace, his mind dazed in the suffocating action he experienced from Griffin.
“Griffin, get a hold of your senses!” Alistair backed a step away, rubbing the parts of his body that ached. “I don’t need any broken bones.”
If this was not a hallucination, and everything was the reality his eyes had seen, this meant that there was something very strange happening. Even though being a Vampire seemed strange enough and many humans would conclude that his existence was the strangest thing, this event of his sister standing next to him was out of the strange-ordinary. “This makes no sense,” He said to himself, trying to console his senses and his frantic heart. “I need a drink, it’s the only viable solution. This is impossible,” he continued his rant, turning to Emma. “Impossible.” He stared at her for a long time, assessing her features, comparing every detail his memory could muster of his late sister, yet he couldn’t decide if it was the lack of alcohol or the after-effects of the alcohol but every characteristic she had was exactly the same as his sister, it was the greenness of her eyes, the wavy brown hair and even the way she frowned in concentration.
“Just who are you?” Griffin asked, not really expecting an answer.
“She’s my helper,” Ner replied for Emma. He had walked around the basement inspecting the items of Henry Dale. He had found something rather odd in the basement. He noticed that all of Henry Dale’s items looked newly bought, but the cabinet against the wall was the only old object in the basement. He touched the texture, realising it was an antique made of ancient ebony wood. This particular wood in the present earthly day was difficult to find, the trees were considered endangered.
“Helper?” Griffin said, dumbfounded. That did make sense, he thought. Griffin once again tried to find the logical positivity of Ner’s statement. The Son of Death needed help, he needed someone to aid him from his woes of inserting fear into others and laughing at them when they involuntarily became his slaves. Actually, his mind took a moment to reassess his words, that made absolutely no sense! The girl in front of him who resembled his sister, except for her Technicolor sense of fashion, was definitely human. He could see the Spark within her, undeniably a natural human Spark. It was bright, almost blinding white, unlike when he stared at Alistair - the light within him was grey and a bit smudged. Why would the Son of Death need a normal human to aid him, unless of course he knew who she was in her previous life. Or his and Alistair’s past, and if that was the case, then he should be glad that he got branded a slave on his forehead.
“I need a double, maybe a triple scotch.” His throat ached.
“There are approximately 1.8 million deaths due to binge drinking,” Emma said, finding relief that Griffin was a solid average number of 10.
“Huh?” Griffin stared at his sister, puzzled. Was this really his sister? “Well, at this rate the only death that would kill me is shock, or that guy.” His hand once again pointed to the location of Ner. Griffin did not understand why his damn hand knew the position of the person who was going to kill him. “And I would prefer that any beverage would take me to death, even that distasteful Russian vodka would do, or maybe those pink flamingo drinks.”
“You need coffee to wake up, Grif,” Alistair said. “I understand affection, but that hugging session was unnecessary. You need to lay off of the hard beverages, stick to slush puppies and concentrated juices.” 
Griffin laughed at Alistair’s suggestion, he laughed really hard when Alistair had finished his sentence. “Coffee? Slush puppies? Concentrated juices? I must be losing my mind!” Griffin said, laughing.
While Griffin was in the midst of losing his mind Ner had located a small switch behind the strange antique ebony cabinet. It made a small click sound and revealed an empty dark passage beyond the basement. “That wasn’t there when I came through,” Griffin said. His laughter had stopped. “Maybe it has a few free bottles we could share as an agreement between new ‘helpers’.”
No one responded to Griffin, each of them realised that Griffin would continue to retort to any response they made and that would waste valuable time. Griffin seemed a waste of time and a waste of words. Ner stepped into the dark passage, following him was Alistair, then Emma, and lastly Griffin. They walked five steps into the passage. They heard a singing tune as they drew closer, “It’s autumn, yet no one could tell.”
“I know this song,” Griffin said, pleased that he was able to identify the singer. “It’s that old man Hardy, cowboy 50's star.”
There was a dim light fixed at the end of the passage, they continued to walk through the opening, their feet following the melody of the song. It grew louder as they approached the lit room. When they entered the area, each of them suddenly paused at the discovery of the interior design of the room. There was a metal desk at the centre of the room with a stereo playing Old Man Hardy’s tune, but the four people who stood in Henry Dale’s room failed to notice. The first thing that caught their eyes and made them pause in disbelief was the millions and millions of photographs plastered across the walls of the room. Each and every one of them overlapped each other. The photographs were of families on vacations, graduations, picnics. They all smiled, frozen in a happy state.
“Well, that’s one strange hobby, but a stranger wallpaper to have,” Griffin said, stunned by the photographs that surrounded him. “I thought Henry was the type to collect stamps.”
Alistair pulled one photograph from the wall, turned it over to inspect the contents.
“Alison, Billy and Gribbly Briggs. The names are struck out,” Alistair said, analysing the photograph.
Ner replied, “It’s the people he killed.”

***

Henry Dale stumbled into his secret room, the song played to his senses, strengthening him to stand, even though he had recently devoured a young soul Spark. The room glistened in the light, revealing the photographs of smiling families all over the walls.
“I brought a friend,” Henry said, sitting down on the chair near the metal desk in the middle of the room, “I brought you all a new friend.” He smiled, “Meet the Briggs!” He said enthusiastically to the pictures on the walls.
He raised the photograph in the air staring at it in glee yet for some reason he felt a deep sadness within his chest. “You’ll be happy here.” He spoke to the photograph, “Alison, Billy and Gribbly Briggs, you all will be happy here. See, the way you all smile is everlasting. I know you all are happy.” He smiled with them, but his chest deepened with burdened sadness. “You’ll be happy here,” he said, convincing his chest of the lie. “You will, look, everyone here is happy!” He twirled around the chair, rotating the Brigg’s photograph to the smiling walls. “See, everyone is happy here.” He continued to smile, but as he stopped the swirl of the chair he felt tears on his cheeks.
“Everyone is happy,” he said to himself. “Henry, everyone is smiling.” His chest would not allow him to believe this and his eyes turned to a golden anger as he wiped the tears from his cheeks. “WHY? Why won’t you believe me?” He gripped his chest. “You don’t believe it? Can’t you see it? Don’t you see all their smiles? Don’t you understand?” He shouted. 
He found a pen in the drawer of the metal desk and struck out the names of the Briggs family behind the photograph.
“Are you happy now?” He stood up in anger, pushing the chair behind him, slamming it into the wall. “Aren’t you all happy?” He looked around the room at each photograph. “Aren’t you happy, Lee Evans? Sonya Wilton? Aiden Fergusson?” He eyed each of them as they smiled at him. “WHAT? Are you truly happy?" He shouted, demanding a reply. "Are you really smiling within?"
His chest ached in response and it forced him to realise the truth that they were not happy. His chest continued to ache, the pain increasing, overwhelming his senses. His body felt unsteady at the agony. He fell to his knees, gripping his head with both hands. “WHAT? WHY?” He lowered his head to the tiles, the photograph of the Briggs had fallen to the tiled floor. “Why are you so sad?” His voice softened and tears came streaming from his eyes. “I will remember all of you, I promise,” he whimpered. “Kaylee, can you hear me? Can you see me? I love you.” 
He muttered and uttered secret words of his past, of his real family and Kaylee his daughter. The daughter he sorely missed, the daughter who was the source of the ache in his chest. He promised that he would remember her, he promised that he would stop his actions, he promised to stop, for he loved her more than his death.
“It’s wrong, daddy.” Kaylee appeared in the room, she wore a white dress. “You know it’s wrong,” her angelic voice said. Her body was almost transparent. 
Henry looked up, and found her standing in front of him, her blonde hair covering her shoulders. “Kaylee! I knew you could hear me!” He shouted, finding her presence comforting. He leaned up trying to embrace her yet his hands went through her frame.
“Kaylee!” He screamed in panic, unsure what was happening.
She repeated, “You know it’s wrong daddy.” He continued to try to embrace her, watching her small face repeat the words, but as he continued trying to grasp on to her, he noticed her white dress turning to the colour of blood and her blue eyes crying tears of red.
“No, no, no... Kaylee!" He cried, shaking his head from side to side, trying to comfort Kaylee. "No, no, no Kaylee. Stop. Don't cry," he pleaded, but she would not stop. Her eyes kept dripping red tears and her clothes were overwhelmed with blood, a puddle of it forming at her feet.  "Don’t cry! Daddy is here!” He screamed, reaching for her with his hands, but when he couldn’t touch her even though she bled, he quickly shut his eyes. But instead of the darkness protecting him from her tears, images of blood and her death flashed in front of his eyes and he kept hearing her words.
“You know it’s wrong, daddy.”
“You know it’s wrong, daddy.”
“You know it’s wrong, daddy.”
“You know it’s wrong, daddy.”
“You know it’s wrong, daddy.”
The more he heard her words, the more he saw images of her death flash before him. He remembered her blood that dripped onto his hands, of her small pale dead body in his arms.
“NO!” He screamed out. “Please stop. Please stop. Please,” he whimpered, his hands once again gripping his head. “Forget, let’s forget. Yes, let’s forget,” he said quietly, trying to convince himself that everything was fine. He nodded his head as he repeated the words over and over and then his golden anger in his eyes faded to a crazed black. “Forget, indeed let’s forget.” He saw the Briggs photograph on the floor and picked it up. “You all are happy, everyone’s happy.” He laughed nervously. “We are all happy.” He stood up, finding a pin and pinning the photograph on the wall. “We are all happy.” Henry continued to laugh nervously, “Everything is alright, we are all happy.”

***

 “This is not a happy place.” Ner said, disgusted at all the photographs smiling at him. But he had to admit the song by Old man Hardy was catchy.
“What kind of person keeps photographs of the people he kills?” Emma asked, feeling eerie and unwell in the room.
“It’s a trophy to remember the victim’s death.” Ner said, “Even the Clock keeps an account of all those who die in the universe, the only difference is that the Clock brings them back to life and everyone is part of the Clock." 
“This is disturbing,” Emma said, feeling worse at Ner’s response.
“I’ll take you outside,” Griffin offered, feeling similar to Emma's mood. Emma accepted Griffin's request, a slight relief washing over her, she could not imagine someone killing children, families, and keeping mementos of their deaths as if he was part of the family, storing valuable items after their death to mourn them and remember them. That is what it looked like in the tiny room of Henry Dale, all the photographs he had collected, each of them were happy moments that should be cherished and remembered by family. Even Emma had a few mementos kept on her desk at home. Her and her mother and grandfather smiling. They reminded her of home and of what love really was. Whenever she felt lonely she looked at the photograph and it gave her strength to endure. Maybe Henry Dale was doing the same, he was trying his best to be a part of all those families, or maybe those happy memories. Yet there was no possible way to be a member of a family when you have murdered one of your own. She did not want to understand Henry Dale or stay in his tiny room any longer, so she left with Griffin.
“Dangerous and crazy,” Alistair said, placing the Briggs photograph on the metal desk. He pulled another photograph off the wall, similar to the previous one.
“They are all the same. I never thought Henry would be keeping a secret room like this.”
“There are secrets that everyone keeps,” Ner said, stopping the song on the stereo machine. “When they are dark and flawed, they will be revealed.” It sounded like a warning to Alistair.
Was he implying that Alistair had a dark, flawed secret, waiting to be revealed? Perhaps that was true, but under no circumstances was it flawed. It was nothing like Henry Dale’s, Alistair’s secret would be revealed, but when that time came everything he wanted would be accomplished. He realised that he had to hasten his pace. Ner's subtle warning was making him edgy, he needed to speed up the accomplishment of his goal. It needed to be done soon, he would have to venture out tomorrow and ensure that the Spark he had claimed would be ready and stored within him. He did not know if this would work, but this was the sole purpose for his current survival. He had to risk it.
Son of Death, you will not kill me. You won’t be able to. I will have Emma. I will have Esther back or I will die by the hands of the Spark.


Chapter 9
'When the past is our only future’

Day 2
“Emma, you look horrid!” Griffin said as he opened the bathroom door, finding Emma’s face in the way. “What happened to your eyes?” He asked her, noticing she had large black circles below her eyes, instead of her red spectacles, “Where are your glasses? I think you need to cover up with your big glasses.”
Emma squinted at the talking smudge of what Griffin was to her eyesight, “I lost my glasses, I placed them on the end table and tried to sleep but I couldn’t. I kept thinking on the horrors of Henry Dale and the fact I was sleeping in his house.” She coughed out, "I don't know where I placed them." She coughed out some more.
“Seems like you lost your glasses and gained a cold.” Griffin said examining her face more closely, “Yes, you are definitely sick,” He placed his hand on her head, her head felt hot, “You need to get back in Henry’s spare bed and actually sleep.” He said fulfilling the rightful place of the big brother he was.
“No, no, No way!” Emma exclaimed, “How can I go back and sleep there? Didn’t I just tell you that I was suffering from insomnia and this is not the good kind of insomnia! You know, the good kind, the type where you have to prove that n is greater than zero, with the square root of ‘x’ even though ‘x’ has no number.” She almost drooled at the thought.
“What type of life have you been living? Finding 'x' isn't that every highschooler's nightmare? And there is no such thing as good insomnia, and the image you described is far more frightening than normal or bad insomnia, if such a thing did exist,” Griffin said, picking Emma from the ground, “Let’s get you into bed.”
“No, no. Griffin, I will be killed by the horrors of my mind!” Emma protested, trying her level best to kick her legs to force him to put her down.
“Don't worry too much, I'll be with you." Griffin assured her, "You were always such a drama queen and a bad patient.” Griffin smiled, “Come on let’s get you into bed, kicking and screaming until you get well, like mom used to say.”
“What do you mean?” Emma asked, confused by the words Griffin had spoken. “I’ve never met you or your mother before. I am pretty sure we met yesterday for the first time, I always store numbers of people I’ve met.” Emma said critically, “And when we met,” she said suddenly upset, “Your number 10 head, did not like me.”
Number 10 head, Griffin grinned at her statement, even the tone she used when upset was exactly the same as Esther, how could he not like her. “I do like you, Emma.” Griffin admitted, “You remind me of my sister, I’m actually glad you’re here I found you. Even though of course it could have been under better circumstances. Not with Alistair or Ner.” Griffin shrugged, “Beggars can’t really be choosers. You drink what you can afford or steal.”
“Steal?” Emma said stunned, “I think afford is more appropriate.”
Griffin chuckled, “That's almost something my sister would say, she never liked illegal activities and lawlessness. I think you might be similar in that regard.” Griffin grinned as he found more similarities between Esther and Emma. He reached the bed and tucked her in, “Would you like to know a few details of my sister?” Griffin asked Emma, as she settled in the bed. She nodded her head. 
“Her name was Esther Rose Sullen,” he said, realising only now that Esther was the only one in their family who had received a middle name. Everyone else had just the usual dull name and surname. There was obviously some favouritism from her birth.
“My father and mother cherished her, she was the only girl in our family but she was a trouble maker, she always took the stubborn hard route,” Griffin chuckled, remembering how Esther had protested against a bully and stomped on his foot when she was nine years old. “She was your goody-two-shoes heroine, always eager to help someone in need and do the right thing, it was kind of awful to witness, especially being her older brother. There were people from older grades starting fights with me because of her constant one girl rallies.” He sighed, missing his sister.
“Really? I would never be able to oppose anyone with that much force. She sounds like the opposite of me.” Emma said, thinking about how Griffin could link her to his sister. “Where is she now?”
A sad expression rose across his face. “She died.” He took a moment before he spoke again. “It was in September on a cold day, we were all waiting for her at the church.” Griffin walked to the closed curtains, opening them slightly, a bit of sunlight beamed through the room. “It was her wedding, and funnily enough it was also her birthday.”
“What?” Emma exclaimed.
Griffin explained. “Esther said it was because her groom was forgetful, and this day would be etched into his mind and he would also need to get her a double portion of gifts.” He smiled as he thought about her. “I was never fond of the groom, I think I hated him for stealing away my little sister even though it was plain obvious he made her happy.”
He stared outside the window. “But she never arrived at the church.” He said sadly, he remained silent for a few seconds and then said, “They say it was some sort of accident. A truck got hijacked and the criminal driver lost control in his escape with the truck and smashed into her vehicle.”
“Oh, Griffin, I’m so sorry.” Emma said.
Griffin lowered his voice and said, “We arrived at the hospital and she had all these pipes and needles in her. She was a fighter, she fought through two nights and then she just faded. Death took her. Sometimes I think it was better, she would suffer less pain then having all those pipes within her."
“That’s so sad, I’m so sorry,” Emma said. “I cannot imagine how difficult it must have been for you, your family, and the groom.” Emma said, thinking how she would feel if she lost her mother or grandfather. “It takes time to heal. How is your family and the groom?”
“My family are fine,” Griffin said. They were dead and were probably coping much better than he was, immortality had its good limitations.
“The groom.” Griffin thought about Alistair before he answered. “He had it rough after her death, even though we were still his family. He couldn't find any closure or comfort when he was around us. He couldn't understand her death and why that criminal had also died. I think he wanted the criminal alive so he could kill him, but..." Griffin paused and sighed, "Let's just say he was a real wreck after her death. My family never saw him for six years, but after his disappearance he came back, calmer than before. We became close friends. He never got involved with anyone, never married, never got into a relationship again, and he never mentioned my sister again." Griffin sighed once more. "It's like he kept her under lock and key, but now he is a different person. I can't say what he is thinking. Well, that's the groom for you. I on the other hand have to ask you to forgive my selfishness, because I am genuinely happy that you resemble a part of my sister. This way it makes me believe that she is still here." A slight smile appeared on Griffin’s face, “I’ll get you honey and lemon, and whatever medication for colds and fever I can find.”

***

Alistair finally reached the hospital, it had taken him half the day, even though he had snuck out of Henry Dale’s house at the crack of dawn. He had seen Ner reading a brown book in the study. The Son of Death never slept and neither did Alistair on this particular day. He was anxious and itched to see Esther. He had somehow side-stepped from Ner’s eyesight and escaped from the prison door, Ner never once winced at his presence, which was a bit concerning. When the Son of Death was not worried about where you went it meant he had already known where you were going. But Alistair did not care.
The hospital was in the countryside, away from all the hustle and bustle of the city. The air was fresh, warm and more importantly, there was no noisy and nosy neighbours from the city. The hospital was isolated in fresh greenness and health, in a perfect area to aid in the patients’ recovery. The fresh air and quietness was meant to boost the immune system and lessen the stressfulness of the world that the body took in, yet to Alistair this area seemed to aid the patients towards their peaceful deaths. They would pass away in the greenness of Eden, which was fine to him, everyone should die in a comfortable place, but before the freshness of the hospital would take anyone’s Spark, he needed to extract Esther’s Spark that was hidden in someone else’s body.
Alistair had learnt about this Spark transfer procedure from one of the undead members - the Ghoul, Rebecca Ashton. She was the deputy in charge of an undead troop, led by a man named Cyrus Alvin Dane. Cyrus Alvin Dane was already undead long before Alistair hopped into breath with a dying Spark within his veins. It was rumoured that he was the first undead being on Earth, the first Rapture to find its way to survive. There was no way to verify this, but it seemed to be true. Cyrus had a large amount of knowledge on the unseen elements in the natural world. He had revealed many strategies and procedures regarding Sparks. In Alistair's case, he had instructed Rebecca to explain the Spark transfer procedure to him. It involved finding a reincarnated Spark of someone who lived in a previous life time. Even though the chance of this was practically impossible there was a high possibility for Alistair as it would only occur when someone had loved another so desperately to the point of death. Finding this re-incarnated Spark meant that the body of this person had also been re-incarnated, but with another Spark. The only way to bring the person back to their original state of past was to combine their re-incarnated Spark with the re-incarnated body, making them one.
And this is what Alistair set out to do as he entered the hospital room 305. He walked carefully, trying not to disturb the peaceful air, yet the soft sounds he made with his feet made the patient in the room turn her head at the noise. She turned to face him as she lay in the hospital bed, her eyes lit up in his presence.
“Hi.” She smiled weakly. He noticed that she looked paler and weaker compared to the last time he had seen her, “You haven’t been here in ages, I thought you had abandoned or forgotten about me,” she said as he approached her. He sat near her bedside. “Never,” said Alistair, “I can never forget the one thing I’ve been living for.” He lifted her hand from the bed, holding it gently.
The sunlight shone through the room, the large window displayed the blooming outside gardens. The gardens were various health potential plants, bright with oranges and reds.
“How are you feeling today?” He asked, placing her hand on his cheek.
“Today I feel like Wednesday. In the middle of something.” She sighed. “I keep vomiting the food they feed me. My stomach will not keep it in, they don’t know if it is the medication or if my body has just given up on me.” She felt ill at her honesty. “I even lose my appetite just thinking about it.” Her chest coughed out, interrupting her depressed statement.
"Do you remember?" Her voice lit up, she faked a cough twice. "Isn’t coughing the funniest thing?" She laughed.
He smiled as he understood what she was referring to, the strange occasion of how they had met. They had met through a cough. It was two years ago, Alistair had been in the hospital, observing the hospital standards and what exactly his money was being used for. He was accompanied by the hospital Chief Executive Officer and the station nurse, they had been walking down the hallway when she, Miss Bree White, a sick patient, had accidentally collided into Alistair’s body, avoiding the nurse and the Chief Executive Officer entirely, and she had coughed almost all her slimy insides onto his chest. “Sorry, so sorry.” She had apologised profusely, then coughed out the rest of whatever slime her body needed to take out on to his chest. “Sorry!” She exclaimed as Alistair tried to steady her. The CEO and the station nurse looked appalled, they also apologised on behalf of the patient and rushed around trying to find a clean cloth to wipe off the slimy contents from his expensive suit.
“It’s quite alright,” said Alistair, holding the patient up straight. “Are you fine?”
“Yes, much better!” She exclaimed. “I think all that goo needed to be released, but not necessarily on you.” She blushed in embarrassment, wiping her mouth and then glancing up at his face. “The floor was a better option, I believe,” she said, her eyes finding his face.
Alistair met Bree’s gaze and their eyes locked. As the blue eyes gazed into green eyes, something unknown to them connected. Both of them blinked at each other.
“Do we know each other?” Both of them said simultaneously, “Shake my hand,” she said.
Shake my hand. Alistair was startled by the familiar sentence he had heard. Those were Esther’s words. She always said it when a strange occurrence had taken place. She would always 'utter shake my hand' in disbelief, sometimes prompting strangers to actually shake her hand, adding to the peculiar occurrence.
Alistair asked, “Where did you hear that from?”
“I’ve been saying it all my life. But really, have we not met somewhere? You look very familiar, it seems like I am meant to know you, but strangely enough I can’t remember.” 
He had the exact same feeling she described. He stared at her. This was not Esther, her face was entirely different, her hair colour was wrong and even her accent was Southern but the only real significant feature that could possibly resemble Esther was the colour of this strange patient’s eyes. It was that emerald green, the same colour that Esther had. But still this was not her.
“Alistair,” his name came from her mouth unexpectedly, it seemed as if the words being spoken were not really hers. “Alistair?” She asked in confusion, shaking her head. “Where did that name come from?” She stared at him, puzzled.
“How did you know my name?” asked Alistair. “Who are you?”
“I didn’t know your name,” she said, stunned. “I am Bree White, and I have never met you in my entire life.” She paused for a second. “But why is it that you are so familiar?” She paused again, looking into his eyes. “Why is it that...” Her hands reached for his face, her fingertips caressed his cheek.
“What are you do –,” and before he could finish his sentence she had lifted herself on to her tiptoes and unexpectedly kissed him on his lips. His eyes widened at the action, he was stunned at this strange woman. She had made him forget the question he was about to ask and before he could push her away he tasted her Spark. It was strange that he could taste her Spark through a kiss. Usually he needed to bite the neck and absorb the blood contents before reaching the Spark. The strange Spark from this lady ignited against him, it flickered warmly, reminding him of something he should have known his entire life. It flashed again and he remembered something about Esther that no-one else knew, as soon as he remembered all his senses accepted her and only then did he close his eyes, welcoming this strange woman’s kiss.
She was no stranger, she was Esther, her Spark spoke to him. He didn’t know how he knew, but he could feel it. There were things in life you could not explain and at times you did not really want explained. All you knew was that this was what it was and it needed to be accepted. And Alistair felt this. He did not know this strange woman’s body, but he knew that her Spark was Esther.
“I dreamed of you again,” she said, lying on the bed. She was feeling tired. Alistair snapped out of the cough memory. “I keep having more dreams about you, it’s like a life I will live with you.”
“We are in the park, we are driving,” she said, closing her eyes. “They are ordinary, day to day events. It’s like we are living together in my dreams.”
Alistair smiled, the dreams she described were memories that they had shared in the past. To her they were dreams of a future, but to him they were memories of a past, and with the Spark’s help these dreams and memories they shared would be made into one in the present.
“There is a dream where we go to the fields, golden fields, and we have a picnic.” She opened her eyes wearily. “It’s our favourite place. Do you know those golden fields?” She asked, reliving the dream she had never experienced in this life.
Alistair replied, “Yes, I know them well.” He smiled. “We’ll go there soon. I found the antidote. I found it.”
“Really?” She grew more tired, even though she was excited she wanted to close her eyes.
“Do you trust me?” Alistair asked her.
She whispered in response, “I trust you with my life, Alistair.” And those were the same words she had always said to him in the past. She watched Alistair’s lips draw closer to hers, his breath lingering against her lips. She opened her lips slightly, feeling his warmth when he pressed his mouth gently against hers. She closed her eyes, hearing a foreign ring in the air. It called her to a darkened light.
Time froze.
Alistair felt something unusual in the air as his breath reached her neck, he had sunk his teeth into her delicate skin, extracting the Spark from her very being, but in the process he witnessed a familiar shadowed presence appear in front of him.
The Son of Death emerged from the thin air, his suit releasing smoky dark wisps. The wisps immediately whipped Alistair across the room, forcing him away from Bree, slamming his body against the white wall.
“Why are you harvesting Miss Bree White’s Spark?” Ner asked gravely. He waited for the official procedure of the Clock to commence, but nothing happened. In these events, the person meant to die would be movable, still breathing, and still with a Spark. But in this case Miss Bree White failed to open her eyes, and her body stayed unmovable, even her name above her body started to vanish before his eyes. It turned into static and then faded away as it was erased. This meant that Alistair, the undead abomination, had taken her Spark prior to her death, corrupting the official procedure of the Clock. This meant that Ner had failed to collect the soul Spark on Earth. Ner’s mind recalled the warning in the manual.
A second too late has consequences.
Fortunately he was not a second too late, his mind confirmed. This undead abomination was causing obstacles of order. Even with him not being a second too late, Alistair had forced him to experience a consequence. It was Ner’s fault that he had kept Alistair alive long enough to experience a failure. Something inside Ner burnt, something rather like anger, but he was sure he could not experience that. He decided that he would not take any more chances with this undead abomination. He seemed more like a wild card than Captain Griffin. He would kill Alistair Collins or Alistair Quinn today, right now in this very second. He wondered why he needed to be bothered with this undead’s correct name. It would no longer exist.
His finger lifted to the air, writing out ancient symbols that left fragments of flames and then disappeared into thin air. “You will die,” said Ner, walking towards Alistair. Alistair stood up. Ner’s eyes had a gleam of silver within them, glinting towards the centre of both eyeballs, linking a pentagon to his irises. Ner lifted his hand and forced Alistair to levitate above the ground, but before anything could happen Ner felt a force obstructing him. His hand and body became immobilised. Something held him back, binding him in constraint.
What was happening here? Ner thought. Why could he not move? What or who was this force that he could not lift. "What the..." Ner failed to finish his sentence as he involuntarily disappeared from the hospital room, leaving Alistair to fall to the ground in surprise. Alistair did not know what was happening but gratitude was in store for whatever being assisted him. He felt the Spark he had obtained within him reacting, fighting within his chest. He could not fully dissolve it within his veins for it was not his, it was Esther’s Spark and needed her rightful body.
“Hold on, Esther, just a few more hours,” he promised, recalling the process explained by the Ghoul concerning Spark transfers.

Day 2 and a Half

“Ner? What brings you here?” Two voices asked.
Ner dusted himself from the forced transportation, he immediately recognised the pitch black conference room. “You summoned me here,” he said, staring at the scaly faces of the three Council members. They were the only ones who could stop the flow of time for Death and instantly transmit him through space, it must have been an emergency. But he shrugged off any logical thoughts of the term, ‘emergency’ to the Council. For the Council, the term ‘emergency’ could be that Miss Underwood had printed the incorrect report or one of the old Council portraits hung skew or that the portraits did not represent their grey robes properly on the painting
“Oh, yes,” one of the hooded three said. “It’s a good thing you arrived, but you are an hour early.” He paused in thought. “We still need to wait for the other two and yes, yes Miss Underwood.”
Ner calmly walked to a free chair and sat down in the dark, he did not expect much from this meeting.
“Were you in the midst of something important?” Another hooded member asked.
Ner thought about this question, was he in the midst of something important? Would anyone deem killing an undead abomination important? The answer was easy, it was an obvious, No. They were insignificant maggots, less than insignificant maggots. But why did he feel that he should have ripped the insides of the less than significant maggot, Alistair Quinn, in this very moment. He was annoyed that he had remembered Alistair's name correctly.
“No,” Ner replied, forcing a book to appear within his hand. “Nothing important at all.”
“That does not sound productive at all, Ner. We cannot have you doing ‘non-important’ activities.” The third hooded member on the right side of the table spoke, “You should lie to us, at least.” The other two agreed.
“Your honesty offends us, you must know this by now, we need concrete lies of progress.”
“Yes, concrete lies of progress!” The hooded one seated in the middle exclaimed. All three chanted in song, “Concrete lies of progress!”
As they sang about progress, the other two Council members entered the room from their individual doors. “What’s this song?” One of the Council Members who entered the room asked, but the question came out much slower, it sounded like, "Whhhhhhaaaatttt’ss thisss sonnnnggg?" He coughed a slimy cough. “I’ve never heard it,” he said, lingering on the word never.
The third hooded member on the right hand side of the table said, “It is a new song. Where has it been filed? Miss Underwood’s filing system is appalling. The other day I couldn’t find the ‘Baby Blue Blues’ in the Purple Section and I remember explicitly stating all Blues and Jazzy items should be filed in the Purple Section because it makes obvious logical sense.”
"You are correct, I remember you discussing that with her as she took down the minutes –"
Ner interrupted, "It was concluded that the Baby Blue Blues would remain in the Silver Section as it is a part of the Jazzy items and Jazzy items are filed in the Silver Section because it represents wisdom."
"Oh, Ner is quite right." The three Council members nodded their heads in agreement and the fourth one nodded five seconds later, but the fifth one, Ner’s father, sat silent.
He lifted his pen and tapped against his notepad.
WHAT IS THIS MEETING FOR?
He wrote out in full capital letters, lifting his notepad in the air for everyone to read.
"Ever so rude with the shouting," One scaly member said and the other two laughed. The third one laughed ten seconds later. "Writing in capital letters has no charm like," he paused, thinking really hard which simile would suit, “like...hmm,” he thought some more.
“Like light.” Ner finished for him, closing his book.
All four members finally laughed at the same time, “Yes, yes indeed! Once again you are right Ner!” they all said at different times in congratulating tones.
Death tapped at his notepad again.
YOUR COMMENTS HAVE NO CHARM! WHAT EXACTLY IS THIS EMERGENCY MEETING FOR?
He waved his notepad around the room. "It’s rather important, Death." One scaly member explained, “We all need to be here to discuss something of high importance and urgency.”
AND WHAT COULD THAT POSSIBLY BE?
The tapping of the pen grew aggressive on the paper.
“Well, you see, Death, it’s a surprise,” another member said excitedly.
Death tapped his pen, almost ripping the paper apart.
WHAT IS THIS SURPRISE? AND WHY DOES IT FEEL I WILL BE MORE SUPRISED THAN THE SURPRISE ITSELF!
One member laughed in a choke, “Feelings aside, this is for Miss Underwood, she has been with us for the 100th thousand year!”
“It’s tradition that we celebrate such achievements, usually we just erase them, but Miss Underwood has lasted for the 100th thousand year!” The scaly member bubbled as he spoke.
Death turned his hooded face towards his son, even without an expression it was clear as night what Death felt.
“Miss Underwood has not been with us that long,” said Ner. Confusion and disappointed sighs entered the faces of the four Council members. “She has been with us for 88 987 years.”
One scaly member uttered in revelation, “Really? Only 88 987 years, why does it seem longer? This is rather surprising.” Another member asked, “And how many more years would we have to wait to follow tradition?"
Ner answered him and his father’s annoyance grew, it was almost possible to see red smoke of irritation steam from Death’s hood. He was beyond annoyed. He had been in the middle of something rather important. He had almost completed the perfect title of his newspaper, now he was sure when he returned to his office of worldly clocks he would have forgotten the last word. He felt angered almost to the point of tearing his only source of communication.
I AM LEAVING!!! PLEASE DO NOT BOTHER ME WITH URGENCY FOR SUCH EMERGENCY SURPRISING EVENTS EVER AGAIN!! SEND ME A LETTER!
A Council member responded to Death, “But we did send you a letter, everyone received one.” He lifted the letter from his robe. “See?”
The only response Death made was the slamming of his door as he departed. 
“That was a noisy rude, better than the silent rude,” one member said, and the other three chuckled.
Miss Underwood entered the room. “Miss Underwood, the meeting is adjourned. There was a strange miscalculation. Note that this meeting has been moved forward 11,013 years. Book the date, set up a meeting, send out letters, the floral type, to Death and yes, do invite yourself twenty minutes later.”
The rest of the Council members stood departing from their chairs and to their doors. They left Miss Underwood and Ner alone in the dark room, both of them wondered the same thing. Why exactly had they been brought here? Ner shrugged and snapped his fingers, leaving Miss Underwood alone in the dark conference room.

***

Griffin heard someone knocking violently at the door. He walked towards the door in preparation, expecting some loony human, but instead he found Alistair.
"Sheesh, Alistair. This isn't your house. Have some sort of respect. Don't bang down the door like you are part of the army, planning to break in or invade my home.” Griffin said sternly, watching Alistair pace walk him, but Griffin stopped him from going any further. “Where the heck have you been?”
Alistair snapped, "Out of my way Griffin. I am going to see Esther."
"What are you talking about?" She is not Esther she is Emma,” Griffin said, gripping Alistair’s arm. “I won’t let you see her. What are you planning to do?”
"She might not be Esther right now, but she will be." Alistair said, dazed. He felt Esther’s Spark burning within his chest.
"Hold on a minute, I think you've lost the plot here. She isn’t Esther. You cannot bring Esther back and you know this." Griffin tried to make sense of Alistair’s psycho-babble. “I miss her too, but Emma is not Esther. You cannot replace her, even if they look similar."
Alistair sensed a pain in his chest, Esther’s Spark felt like it was erupting from his insides. "Griffin, remember all the theories I told you about? I went researched a few of the undead members and found enough evidence to implement the practical. I found it. I found her. I found a way to bring Esther back! She is here.” Alistair touched his chest.
Griffin was stunned for a brief second, Alistair could bring Esther back? The idea rang in his mind for a few seconds, but the image of her death replaced the idea of her life as he remembered the hospital and her idle body. It was impossible, his mind told him. She was dead, she could not be brought back, she wasn’t like Alistair or him, an undead. Even if Alistair could bring her back to life, she would not be the same. She would need to murder lives every three months to survive and for his sister to live like that, that would be no life. It was impossible and impractical. He would not allow Alistair to do this.
He stared at Alistair as if he belonged in an asylum. “I think you need to step back and away. You're talking crazy."
“You don’t understand Griffin, I found Esther’s Spark. I have it with me,” Alistair said. “I need to see her, Grif, you should understand this. I," he paused, "I really, really need her back.” He was close to tears. “Everything is a mess, losing her. I can’t... I am so close. You have to understand.”
"Al, there is no way I will let you. I know the pain and the loss better than anyone, but she is not Esther." He said firmly, "She looks like Esther but she is not the same person. Even though you say you researched this. How sure are you? Do you have any idea what it means when you bring her back? And how sure are you that you can do it?”
Alistair remained quiet at the question, he was not sure he could bring her back, but he felt the burn within his chest, Esther was calling to him. How could he deny her request? The love of his life was calling out to him. All the promises he had made to her rushed back vividly to his mind. There was no other explanation, this would definitely work or... or what? He could not think of Esther not being by his side again, the idea of this not working was unacceptable, he could not be without her.
“Griffin, out of my way.” Alistair pulled his arm from Griffin’s grip. He ran towards the staircase but Griffin was faster and stood in front of him. "Al, I will not let you. Emma has her own life."
"Griffin, move away!" Alistair’s eyes changed colour. "Esther's life was taken too suddenly! Dammit, Griffin. I don't care about anything else." He was not about to let Esther’s brother oppose her life.
“I’m not moving, Al. She looks like my little sister, even though she isn’t Esther I am glad to see her living as a human. There is no way, no way I will let you do this. Let her live, Al. Stop this." Griffin’s eyes glowed red with warning. "She will not die again."
"She won't die! She'll be Esther again. She will be happy, she'll be with us. With me." Alistair said, finding Griffin's words absurd.
Neither of them gave in. They stood still, facing each other. Alistair's eyes glowed violet and Griffin's glowed red, their eyes locking as they simultaneously uttered the words to bring the power of the undead into their veins. Both their bodies glowed with a dark light. Alistair threw his fist at Griffin’s face, Griffin dodged behind Alistair but Alistair turned to face Griffin, throwing rapid punches at Griffin’s body, attempting to hit his vital organs.
Griffin dodged a few blows but was injured by the punches on his ribs. He attempted to draw blood from his finger so that he could draw a symbol on his palm, but failed when Alistair punched him to the ground. Alistair trapped Griffin below. “I will kill you to bring her back Griffin," Alistair growled.
Griffin summoned his power and forced a few books and the butcher knife from Henry’s kitchen to harm and slash Alistair. Alistair rolled off Griffin a split second before they hit, the books colliding against the floor and the knife ploughing into the ground near Griffin's head. This was a waste of time, Alistair thought. He could not battle Griffin with the limited time he had. He did not know when Ner would be back, he needed to get Emma, Esther’s body before Esther’s Spark would burst from his insides. He quickly crawled onto the ceiling, running towards Emma’s room. Griffin tried his best to levitate all the objects in Henry’s house to stop Alistair, but they were too slow and so was he. He tried to follow upwards with Alistair but his powers were inadequate and he could only watch Alistair hurry into Emma’s room. 
Alistair saw Emma asleep and he lifted her rapidly from the bed into his arms, she stayed asleep even with the hurried motion. He held her in his arms and placed his lips against hers, Esther’s Spark igniting from his chest, leaving his his insides as it raged with release, travelling from Alistair’s body into Emma’s body, finally finding relief.
Emma’s eyes opened wide as she felt an electric force enter her body and her soul. It twirled and coiled within her, merging and entwining with her soul. She screamed in pain as she felt it collide and combine with her soul. Tears fell from her eyes as she stared at Alistair’s blue eyes in weeping agony.
“Alistair,” she whispered, “it is dark here. So dark and cold.”
She screamed out again in pain as the Spark transfer process continued. Alistair gently placed her on the bed, caressing her, murmuring words of comfort even though he could not know the torture she endured. He held her hand tightly in his.
“It’s alright Esther, everything will be fine, I promise,” he reassured her but more so himself.
Griffin finally stepped in to the room. “What have you done? Get away from her!” He screamed at Alistair, yet Alistair remained by her side, unmoved, still lost in his words of assurance. "What have you done, Alistair!" Griffin demanded, coming closer towards Emma's body. Her veins were an electric yellow, as if they were shocking her into pain. She kept screaming for any comfort but still none came. Her body jolted from the bed and began to glow bright white, briefly returning to normal before glowing white again. It kept phasing to the glow but as it continued her arm vanished. Alistair's hand seeped through hers and he only grasped the air as her arm disappeared. He felt his heart stop and he gasped.
“Her body is disappearing!” Griffin exclaimed in a panic.
Her arm vanished, and then her leg, and then the lower half of her body vanished, and then reappeared. It continued to appear, disappear and reappear, each of her limbs visible and then invisible. She continued to scream in pain, sweating profusely, glowing lightning white and then returning to normal. Her eyes radiated with electricity, the veins in her irises lines of current, yet tears kept streaming from her cheeks. Suddenly her suffering screams stopped and she was silent. Her illuminated face and eyes looked drained as they faded into darkness.
 “What have you done?” Griffin asked, kneeling down beside the bed, staring at Emma’s silent body. “What have you done?” His heart pricked with loss as he watched Emma’s body remain in a constant state of illuminated reappearing and disappearing. “What have you done?” Griffin uttered again as he saw his sister fade from his eyes.

Chapter 10
‘This day is one of those days.’

Day 3
Griffin stood up abruptly, slamming Alistair into the wall. “What have you done?” He shouted angrily. “Look at her!” He gripped Alistair’s collar, almost punching Alistair's eye from its socket.
Alistair failed to feel the pain, all he really felt was numb. He looked over Emma’s body, his eyes glazing as he watched her body shake in pain, the voltage electrifying her body. What was happening? He thought to himself, this was not the procedure described to him by the Ghoul. It was not meant to be like this.
“This isn’t right,” he said as Griffin hit him with the seventeenth punch.
“Right? What isn’t right is you!” Griffin raised his voice, enraged. He continued to knock his fists into Alistair’s face and then stopped, feeling spent of his strength. He bent his head towards the wall, and slumped down next to Alistair. They both collapsed to the carpet, sitting next to one another.
“Alistair,” Griffin said. “Why couldn’t you leave her?”
Alistair did not say anything. He aimlessly stared at the lifeless glowing body of Emma, his eyes glistened in agony.
“I just got her back,” Griffin said.
“I ?” Alistair could not respond. What could he say? He knew Emma was an innocent. He should have known better than anyone about the gift of the Spark. Emma was not a murderer, she wasn’t malicious or wicked. She was innocent. He knew from the day he had met her in the gallery, he knew she had her own life, her own Spark. What exactly had he done? He stared at her electrified body, her veins flashing with electricity and her lifeless body jolting whenever the phosphorescent glow illuminated her.
“She’s still alive, Grif.” Alistair whispered.
Griffin replied, “That’s not alive. She looks like a doll that is only breathing through electric pain.” He placed his hand on his head, “Do you know how long this will last? Do you know what happens to her after this?”
Alistair was silent.
“Didn’t you say you researched this thoroughly?” Griffin demanded weakly.
More silence.
Griffin shook his head in disbelief while Alistair continued to stare at Emma’s body, his heart drowning in guilt, but nothing could prepare him for the sudden change in her body. There was an increased pace of the illuminated current that claimed Emma’s body. It rapidly ignited her body and then returned her to normal. This continued for twenty seconds, then she returned to her natural colour.
Griffin and Alistair rushed towards her, wondering what was happening. She lay still on the bed, almost dead. No current flow was seen around or within her, her veins and skin were normal. Griffin hesitated at first but wrapped his fingers around her wrist to feel for a pulse, but there was nothing, no regular beat of life. Alistair gazed at Griffin, searching for hope but Griffin shook his head in grief-stricken loss. Alistair's heart stopped. He could not accept this, he moved his head close to hers, trying to feel her breath, hoping the expression on Griffin’s face was not true, but no air released from her body. He closed his eyes tightly, the emotions of disappointment, pain, sorrow, regret, grief slammed into him at once.
“No, no, no,” he repeated in disbelief, “no, no.” He whimpered, shutting his eyes tightly, tears falling from his eyes. He lifted his arms, wrapping them tightly around her.
Alistair gripped her close to him. He would not let her go, he could not let her go. Memories from the hospital came rushing to his mind, he remembered the day she died - he had held her the same way. The doctor said he could do no more, that her heart had given in while the heart rate monitor machine sounded the alarm of death. The flat line sound echoed in the room as Esther lay lifeless on the hospital bed, her body bruised and bandaged. When he walked in the room he had been devastated when he saw her. She couldn't be dead, there was no possible way. No possible way that Esther could be dead. 
“Esther, do you hear me?” He whispered as he did back at the hospital, but she did not move or respond, nor in the memory of the hospital.  He caressed her face lightly, "Esther, do you hear me?" His voice trembled as he asked again, just as he did back at her hospital bed, but she kept silent, the same as his memory of her first death. He asked her again, his voice quivering, and with every question silence answered. The anguish in his heart increased as it convinced him of her death over and over again. He closed his sorrowful, teary eyes, the drops falling on her skin. He clutched her body to his as his heart broke a million times over.
“No, no, no," Alistair cried out, his heart aching as he held her against him. "You can’t leave me,” he said, using the same words he had uttered in the hospital. “Not again. Please. Not again," Alistair cried out.
Alistair’s heart ached in despair and remorse. He loved Esther. He loved her with his soul and so much more. He thought of her every second when he lived with his natural Spark, and he thought of her even more in his undead state. He was meant to bring her back to life, but instead he had sacrificed Emma Dove, Bree White, all these innocent lives for this. What was this? He asked himself over. And as he held her in his arms for the very last time, he realised he had sacrificed everything to lose her again.
 He whispered, hugging her closer to him, “Please, please, please,” he pleaded. “Open your eyes." 
“That's enough! Get away from her!” Griffin shoved Alistair away from his sister. “Damn you, Alistair,” Griffin cried in a low voice, “this is your fault this time, I won't forgive you. You’ve killed her.”
Alistair heard Griffin’s words and knew them to be true. He had killed her, this was his fault. He had murdered three innocent lives for... what was this for? He questioned himself. What exactly was this for?
His heart ached bitterly, “Grif, I’m sorry.” He swallowed.

***

Ner had finally found his footing back into Henry’s household, the entire kitchen and living room were in a mess, books, broken statues, vases and glasses, a shelf and a rather large butcher knife were scattered on the floor. An interesting welcome, Ner thought. Perhaps Henry Dale had passed by and had already died by the hands of his undead servant, Griffin Sullen, but what exactly would happen to the undead body? Ner contemplated this, when the undead died would their body vanish? And what of the stolen Sparks? The undead remnants were unknown and he was interested in the discovery. This would also add to the research for Miss Underwood. He paused for a moment, thinking about something he seemed to have forgotten.
“Ah.” He uttered that annoying word, as his brain processed what he had left out. Alistair Quinn.
He had left that insignificant maggot at the hospital. What was he doing at the hospital, devouring Bree White’s Spark? Ner had placed a tracking device within Alistair into both his wrists and neck during their brief, bloody, contract agreement. He had already calculated the potential of Alistair losing his right and left arms, which was fairly high, especially after the fact he had devoured Bree White’s Spark and made Ner fail in his duty. Alistair tried to portray a figure of justice, with a strong belief in wrong and right, but it was all maggotic lies. It seemed as though Ner had failed in fully evaluating and analysing Alistair. He was missing something, and it was lost at the hospital with Bree White. Nonetheless, there was a solution to this. Ner decided the only solution was to remove Alistair’s arms one by one, very, very slowly and painfully, after he had found him, of course. According to the tracking device Alistair’s current position was right above Ner. Henry Dale’s spare bedroom.
The only issue with the tracking devices, was that one could not instantly transmit one's self to the tracked prey, but it was definitely possible to transmit to the surroundings. Instead of his usual instant snapping transmission Ner glided towards the staircase, but before he could take another glide onto the staircase step, he heard keys turning at the front door. Ah, he said the annoying syllable in his mind as he identified the responsible culprits of the scattered objects in the room.   
Henry Dale opened his front door, feeling high above ecstasy. “Today’s the day.” He smiled entering the door. He walked in, finding his home in a state of after effect-earthquakes.
“Oh dear!” he exclaimed in surprise, “What on earth has happened?” He hurried to the broken porcelain fragments on the floor. “That was an antique! I’ll never get a vase like this again,” he said, bending down to retrieve the pieces, placing each piece slowly on to his other hand. “This was a gift, irreplaceable,” he whispered to himself, “irreplaceable.”
Ner stepped out of the shadows. “A similar version of the Blue and White porcelain of the Ming Dynasty.”
“It’s not similar, it is an original.” Henry replied, his voice low.
“Really?” Ner walked a few steps forward, his hands in his pockets. “The blue seems rather feint, don’t you think?” Ner asked, not expecting an answer.
“Irreplaceable!” Henry snapped, turning his crouched body around and hastily throwing the irreplaceable sharp porcelain pieces at Ner. Ner side-stepped the razor-sharp objects and they cracked into the wall.
Henry Dale quickly disappeared from sight, blending into the shadows. Ner’s eyes followed Henry into the darkness. “You are the first undead to hide,” Ner said, scrutinising Henry in the corner of the room. Henry's body was twitching.
“I know who you are,” he barked, “you are here to take my life. Son of Death.” His body twitched violently as if he was transforming into something. “You want to take the Sparks?” He continued to roar, “Yes, yes, yes.” His voice softened. “I don’t deserve them, these Sparks, I... I don’t deserve them,” he whimpered, cowering closer to the corner wall. “Do you know? Do you understand?” He sobbed, close to tears. “No, no! No one understands!” He snapped bitterly.
Ner stepped forward, lifting his fingers to the air, readying himself to call on Phase 3 of Dark Interpretations.
“I waited for this,” Henry put his ear to the wall as if he had heard something. “I waited for this day, waited for you to come, I knew you would come.” He let out another whimper, as if he was injured. “It’s what I deserve, their faces won’t fade.” He put his other ear to the wall, as if listening for something. “Please, please, oh, please, make them fade,” he cried softly.
“MAKE THEM FADE!” He shouting at Ner, his flaming eyes turning to face Ner.
Ner wrote the ancient symbols in the air, summoning Phase 3 of Dark Interpretations. The symbols flickered with orange flame and disappeared. The blackness of his suit crept out like a sticky black sludge oozing from his clothing. The sludge formed a circle around Ner, then lit up in blue flames, creating a shield to protect its owner.
Henry’s body twitched to the point of breaking his bones within his skin, the cracking sounds echoing against the wall. ‘Creak’ His elbow disjointed, ‘Creak’ his ankle dislocated, ‘Creak, Creak, Creak.’ All his bones dislocated from their original position, spawning a new creature underneath his skin. “Death Take Me,” He said loudly, calling out to Ner, his newly forged carcass leaping to harm Ner. Henry’s insect-like anatomy, with its dislocated bones, had formed a new set of limbs on his backside. He used them to thrust at Ner, but Ner’s barrier of black sludge and blue flames kept him guarded.
“Barriers! Everyone has these barriers!” Henry shouted out crazed, his eyes bursting into golden flame. The flame slithered from his eyes on to his face, tattooing his skin. It wrapped his entire body in the glow. “Where have you hidden Kaylee?” He demanded, "Ner, where have you taken my daughter?” He repeatedly stabbed Ner’s barrier with his new set of limbs. “WHERE?”
Ner did not respond, he had no idea who Kaylee was, he felt his barrier weaken as it tried to keep up with the pace and force of the attacks. Ner immediately grasped a few wisps of the blue flame, creating hardened chains of purple flame. He thrust them towards Henry’s limbs. They wrapped around his skin, but they immediately broke as the glowing golden tattoo on Henry’s skin ignited. This was the first time that Ner’s chains had broken, they were made to grip any living being until death, but this was an undead being.
Henry’s limbs were beginning to penetrate the shield. Ner had to side step a few of the attacks. One of Henry’s new found legs rocketed within the barrier, it found its way an inch from Ner’s face and the bone seeped through from Henry’s skin. It was sharp and pointy, splitting into two. It began to rotate rapidly, and quickly scrapped the surface of Ner’s face before Ner could turn away. Ner felt something seep from his face, but it soon healed. He touched the strange liquid. What was this red liquid? 
“Where is my daughter?” Henry yelled, more of his bones seeping out from his skin. They erected into bony spikes all over his body. “MY DAUGHTER!” He demanded.
Ner backed away, trying to recover his shield. 
He observed Henry Dale. The source of his power was his bones, protected by the golden flame currently wrapped around his body. If he could penetrate the golden glow and Henry Dales' bones, find his way to penetrate the heart... He assumed that this undead being would die, but the research books he had scrutinised were related to Vampires, and not Zoliqs. He had no information on the method to kill a Zoliq. Yet, even so he would attempt to prove his theory by any method possible, even to the point of advancing to Phase 10, the final level of Dark Interpretations. He would ensure the death of this undead being.
Ner grabbed the wisps of blue flames from his shield and forged a hundred double bladed knives; he threw them out towards Henry Dale, angling them towards to the weak parts he saw on the spiky anatomy. Out of the one hundred he had thrown, only three penetrated within the Henry’s body. The rest of the knives crumbled into pieces.
“Knives won’t stop me,” Henry said, preparing his next attack which was removing the erected bones from his stomach region and then throwing two of them straight at Ner’s face. “But my bones will stop you.” Henry threw the rest of the four bones at Ner. 
Ner immediately grabbed one of Henry’s bones. He held it in his hand, placing the blue flame on to it. He noticed that the bone structure had a red tip at the piercing edge. He summoned a vial from the air broke off the red tip into the vial before it dissipated into thin air. Ner ran towards Henry, disappearing as Henry thrust towards Ner’s body. Ner materialised behind Henry and drilled into the bone over the first knife wound. He withdrew the bone and punctured the second and third knife wound swiftly into Henry’s body. Henry shrieked out in pain as he felt the piercing bone hit his heart. He felt his insides bleed profusely, the bone had punctured his heart and he was breathless. He panted as he tried to understand the reason for the bleeding in his heart. He tried to breathe in the air surrounding him but his chest clasped within and it ached in anguish.
“Kaylee. Do you see her?” He whispered, his eyes in a pained daze, his body returning to its natural state, the bones and limbs he had extracted seeping back within his skin. “Do you see her?” He whispered again, glancing from side to side, looking for his daughter as his body collapsed to the ground. His hand tried to reach out, searching for his daughter, but all his hand found was the air and the cold floor. Blood trickled from his coughing mouth. His skin was dehydrating, aging rapidly, the texture grew dry and the pigmentation dark. The skin faded as if it was slowly being ripped off the bone and then it disintegrated into thin air. Only the bone remained, but this too started to age. The density of the bone grew weaker, crumbling into ash. “Kaylee,” Henry Dale uttered his last word, seeing the white shoes of his daughter. He tried to lift his head to see her before his eyes shut, but everything turned black as his decaying bones shattered into a million small pieces.
“Ah.” Ner let out unexpectedly, as one of Henry Dale’s fragmented bones flew into his skin and through the insides of his chest. Before Ner could process this, he heard someone race down the staircase. It looked like that maggot, Alistair Quinn, but once again, as in the hospital, Ner was immobilised. This time he felt out of breath and his vision was blurry. He tried to stabilise himself, but as he tried he transported to the Council Room, then transported back to Henry Dale’s house, then to a mountain, then back to Henry Dale’s house, then to various random places. He fell to his knees, urging himself to concentrate as he kept leaping through space and time. He closed his eyes thinking of where he should be, yet still he felt his body continuously travel through unwanted places. He could not stop it, he felt something within his chest penetrate further, the piece of bone that had penetrated his body. He gulped large breaths of air, trying to find a way to break through, thinking of the safest place. As he continued to focus and concentrate he eventually felt a quietness, there was a slight pain in his chest but he was quite sure he should not be feeling this. The pain was manageable, he kept concentrating on the place he felt safe, the tranquil place, his father’s office, the office of Clocks. He snapped his fingers, his body moderately calm and relaxed.
He felt as if he had transported to his safest place but when he opened his eyes, he found himself near the bedside of a resting Emma Dove.

Chapter 11
'The things you want are the things you are most likely to need’

Alistair darted in heated determination from Henry Dale’s house to find the source of Esther’s second death. His body was drenched in sweat as he ran. He could not control his emotions, he had lost Esther a second time, everything he was living for was gone in a matter of seconds, yet he still lived and breathed on this earth. Did any of this make sense? Esther, the person he loved more than himself, more than this earth, had died again. He had killed her, yet still he lived and continued to live without her. All that remained within him was the constant suffering agony. First he was numb and disillusioned but after a few minutes all he felt was anger. He wanted to take out his fury on the people who had promised him this false life. He passed Jeane Street, turning into Kristy Lane, and strode a few blocks into Caria Avenue, locating the place he had first met the Ghoul, Rebecca Ashton. The place was known as the Mystery Bar, believed to be the oldest bar in Raines, dating back to 943 AD. The purpose of the bar in the past was to accommodate weary strangers from their battles with life by providing them with freshly baked warm bread, but since then the reason for its existence was to make a hefty profit and drown wounded souls into more despair and debt. Alistair entered the bar, shoving the door from his sight.
The bar had empty stalls available, only three tables were filled and the patrons on them were already high in an alcoholic dreamland. Alistair walked to the bartender. “Where is she?” He demanded.
“Sir, we are about to close.” The bartender swallowed, pretending to be calm. “The ‘shes’ of the bars have left for the night.” He tried to maintain a firm voice but it came out shaky.
“You tell me where Rebecca Ashton is or I will rip your throat out!” Alistair said, grabbing the neck of the innocent bartender.
“Handling the staff that way, means you must be desperate to see me.” A woman said, her voice rich and provocative. Alistair let go of the bartender’s neck and quickly found his hands on the woman’s neck.
“Oh!” Rebecca let out startled.
“You tell me what went wrong and you tell me how to fix it or I will rip your feeble vocals out.” Alistair gripped her neck tighter. She smirked, disappearing from his grasp like a breezy wind.
“Calm down now, Alistair.” She seated herself on a bar stool, “Have a seat and I’ll pour you a free drink,” she offered.
"I don’t want your damn drink!"
She flicked her dark sunset hair back, revealing her low cut dress in front. “The things you want are the things you are most likely to need.” She grinned. “This is what Cyrus says.” She hovered from her seat, then breezed next to Alistair. “Alistair, why are you so angry?” She asked, her voice filled with mock concern. “Will you tell me?” She whispered in his ear, giggling.
He pushed her aside, exasperated. “I found Esther’s Spark and I found her body.”
His statement added a glint in her eyes, “Oooooo,” she puckered her lips in excitement. “Then we must go see Cyrus.”

Cyrus Alvin Dane slowly paced the 20 meter hallway, only really pacing four meters of the entire hall. He took in thoughtful strides as he contemplated a matter of great importance. “If, say we do, and perhaps we shall,” he clasped his hands behind his back as he walked at a steady pace, “it could be that we...” He broke his methodological walk and stopped in the middle of the hallway, casting his eyes to the ceiling. “And if we....No, no, no we shall not! Definitely not! It’s quite, what’s the word?” He pointed his finger to the man guarding the door and waited for an answer. The guard responded, “Bad?”
“Bad isn’t the word I am seeking, Dear Eric,” he said, and continued to walk forward. “This is why you are a guard, but do try and choose a better word.” Cyrus edged the guard on.
Guard Eric grunted in a sigh. “Not good?”
“Terrible structure there, and a lack of attention to the proposal.” Cyrus shook his head in disappointment and he smiled playfully. “Dear Eric, a lesson to take to heart in every instruction given, ‘a’ is singular and you my friend have used two words.” He turned around, reaching the fourth meter boundary and paced back towards Eric. “What’s that old saying? Third time’s a charm. Everyone deserves at least three chances, let’s hear the word Eric.”
“Sad?” Eric tried his third charmed word.
Cyrus once again stopped his pacing and glanced to the ceiling, considering the word Eric had spoken. “Sad? Almost there Eric. Almost, but the word I seek is ‘incomplete’. And why do I say that, you might be asking with your sad and confused expression.” Cyrus continued his walk. “That doesn’t matter Dear Eric, and neither does your sad and confused expression, but are you the slightest bit interested?” He gazed across to where Eric stood.
Guard Eric swayed his head, but before Cyrus could generate a comment the door opened wide and Rebecca strolled in with a guest.
“You’ve come bearing a gift, Dear Rebecca,” said Cyrus, his hands clasped tightly behind his back. “A gift far exceeds a polite knock on the door.” He glimpsed at Rebecca and then at the gift she had brought. “And who are we unwrapping today, at this very minute, why, isn’t it Alistair Quinn? Where did you find him Rebecca? You know I enjoy tales on tales of the lost and found.”
“He sought me out.” She nodded, waiting for some sort of approval from Cyrus. He flashed a devilish smile and nodded back at her, confirming his acknowledgement. “And what brings this gift here?” Cyrus asked, still baring all his clean teeth.
Rebecca approached Cyrus from behind and placed her arms around his neck. “He’s here to plead,” she whispered in his ear, setting her head against his. “Did you hear that, Alistair?” Cyrus asked, snickering. “Are you really here to plead?”
“No,” Alistair said, staring at the duo. He had met Cyrus Alvin Dane thrice. The first time was when he had recently been converted into an undead being and needed guidance, the second time was more coincidental than the first, and this encounter would be the third. 
Alistair recalled the first meeting he had had with Cyrus, it had been night and Alistair was on his way home, he walked down the usual alley but had suddenly witnessed a crowd gathering in a circle. He approached them and saw a man crouched down in the centre, he drew something with his finger on the ground, the image glistened with silver then it disappeared.
“Dear Fellow Kin.” The man announced, standing up wiping his finger on his clothes, “Those who saw the silver light and those who desire to, the options we seek are marvellous, provided we keep within the boundaries. Shall I introduce myself?” He asked the audience, not waiting for a reply he continued, “Cyrus Alvin Dane is my name and my designation,” He mischievously grinned, “A shepherd guiding the lost.”
It was at this first encounter with Cyrus, where Alistair had raised his hand and asked a simple question that plagued his mind and Cyrus answered him with enticing theories, possible ideas and an endless smirk that contained mystery. The exchange changed Alistair thought process; he left the meeting renewed with hope of a reset of his entire life.
“I am not here to plead, Cyrus.” Alistair said firmly, “I am here to get an explanation or I will kill every one of you.”
“Pretty heated aren't we, Dear Alistair." Cyrus arched his eyebrow playfully. "And you desire an explanation?” 
“Rebecca told me I could save Esther with those damn Spark transfer procedures!” Alistair spat out, “But that was a lie!”
“Alistair, Dear Alistair.” Cyrus grinned, a taste of mischief in his eye, “Perhaps, I need to include you in the conversation I had with Eric,” Cyrus pointed his finger to Eric, a rather quick introductory greeting, “The lesson on instruction is to follow every small insignificant detail. So, I’ll hear you out. Stand and speak with me Alistair.” Cyrus requested, but instead of remaining standing Cyrus began to walk, leaving Rebecca to lean on her own feet. He continued to pace as before, waiting to hear the words from Alistair’s mouth.
“I found Esther’s Spark,” Alistair said slightly irritated as he stood eying Cyrus pace the hallway.
“Step 1, completed.” Cyrus glanced quickly to the side then cast his eyes above, “Continue.” He said.
Alistair continued as instructed, “I found her current body.”
“Step 2, completed. My dearest Alistair, this seems pleasing to the soul.” Cyrus beamed pacing once again, “Carry on.”
“I retrieved her Spark and placed it in her body.” Alistair stated, “But she died.”
“Step 3, incomplete.” Cyrus stopped from his pacing and he chuckled, finding Alistair’s statement hilarious, “Eric did I not say incomplete was the word? Do you understand now, why that is? Do any of you understand why?”
Eric, Rebecca and Alistair kept quiet. Alistair was enraged when he had entered the bar but as soon as he spoke to Cyrus, his feelings of anger seeped from him and all he was left with was something near to indifference. He did not understand why Cyrus had this effect on him. They all observed Cyrus continue to walk on, as if his steps might solve and answer his question.
“Dear Rebecca and Alistair, I do conclude that there was a,” He paused for a second, “Eric what word am I searching for here?” The guard grunted and looked at Alistair, the cause of him being examined, “Incomplete?” The guard guessed.
Cyrus was disappointed in Eric again yet there was a half smirk on his mouth, “Eric, are you paying attention to this lesson? The obvious word that I would be seeking is, ‘miscommunication.’ Yes. There was a miscommunication, in the instructions given out. Thus, let me be of aid to all three of you.” Cyrus walked much more slowly, taking smaller steps, “During this Third Step, was there electricity or were there flames? This question is directed to Alistair, there isn’t a need to raise your hand.” Cyrus grinned.
“Her body had electric voltage moving within her, which was not part of the instruction or the process.” Alistair said defensively even though he had no reason to be.
“Now, now, isn’t that something of interest?” Cyrus said amazed by Alistair’s words, “I believe Step 3, is now complete.” He sounded delighted.
“How is that complete?” Alistair tone rose, anger in his features, “She died! That Step 3 you are so bewildered by killed her!” 
“Dear Alistair, Step 3 did not kill her. She is alive.” Cyrus said, thrilled.
“I saw her, she’s dead! How can you say she is alive? When I saw her die! She wasn’t breathing! She had no pulse!” Alistair protested angrily.
Cyrus explained, his voice lively, “Alistair, the value and importance of Step 3 is whether it was electric or if it was fire. Now from your observations we definitely know Step 3 was electric.”
Alistair had had enough, he snapped out, “Cyrus, what has this got to do with electricity or flames? She isn’t a step!" The emotions inside Alistair were breaking out, but there was this strange force field that tried to suppress them, it seemed to be coming from Cyrus.
“Why of course!” Cyrus agreed, he had stopped pacing, “She is not a step, she is our solution and Alistair, Dearest Alistair only you can truly save her. Should I tell you Step 4? It entails her rising from the dead after the electric transition.”
“Step 4? I don’t understand.” Alistair said confused, yet his heart emerged with slight hope, “And how do you know she isn’t dead?” He asked objectively, showing an interest in the fourth step.
“Patience, Dear Alistair. Here’s the proposal, it is important to pay attention here. This contract is one of blood and commitment, there will be no turning back from this point. As equals you must understand this, do you agree?”
Alistair nodded his head, feeling like this was the first real mistake he was making. “A nod is as good as the deed,” Cyrus devilish grin grew bigger, “Alistair, you must be ready for the unexpected.” Cyrus said, snickering from ear to ear, he swiftly got a hold of Alistair’s wrist pricking it with a foreign blade, the blade ignited with inscription as it made contact with Alistair’s blood.
Alistair knew he was agreeing with emotion, but he could not help it, he fully accepted the proposal even if he knew that the terms and conditions were unknown, he had not heard any of the limitations and assumptions of the proposal, he just nodded his head because he desired Esther and this time, surely with everything that had happened, this time she would definitely come back to him.
“Signed, sealed and agreed.” Cyrus eyes grew dark with excitement, “The first step in Step 4, we must find Esther Rose Sullen.”
***
Ner!” Griffin exclaimed startled by Ner’s sudden appearance, his body had this strange urge to bow down before Ner and acknowledge him as someone of majestic importance, but Griffin’s mind hesitated and stood its rebellious ground.
Ner shook his head, shrugging off the abrupt time and space travel, he gained his composure and inspected his surroundings. The first item of interest he noted was Emma Dove, there was no sign of the black leather chair, nor the various shaped bony Clocks he was expecting, instead there lay Emma Dove in front of him, she was asleep, oblivious to any events that had taken place.
“Ner!” Griffin called out, forcing Ner to turn his head, “Ner.” Griffin said again, sounding drained of thought. This was the third time Ner had heard his name from his undead servant.
“Yes?” Ner queried.
“Alistair, he..,” Griffin tried to explain, “He...” But he realised he couldn’t find the words. Ner sighed which came out like a growl, the purpose of having a servant was for them to speak of significant events not to bottle the words in their vessel. Ner faced Griffin, eying him sternly, “What did Alistair do?”
“He killed her.” Griffin said under his breath. “Alistair, killed her.” He uttered again, “She was filled with electricity,” Griffin relived the past minutes of his sister’s death, “He said he had located her Spark and he had it within him.” Griffin rambled out his sentences, “I was slow, far too slow to stop him. Dammit, I should have been faster.” Griffin shut his eyes, blaming himself wishing he had a bottle of something to swallow his sorrow.
 “He killed Emma Dove?” Ner asked needing clarification.
Griffin confirmed, “Yes.”
Ner walked towards the bed where Emma lay. He observed her from a distance. Dead? This human was dead? The one that was meant to assist him on Earth to find all these undead beings was dead? He bent his head near her face, examining her features.
“Dead.” Ner said, inspecting Emma’s lifeless face. “Are you really dead?” He asked her, waiting for a response but her breathless form made no reply. In order to establish the truth and the fact she was dead, Ner placed his hand in his pocket and tapped the golden watch. If she was dead her name would be erased, all her details of her identification would not appear. Her details would be invisible to any eye. The sound of the tap pressed the golden pocket Clock button and it revealed the truth, Emma Dove’s name appeared above her head but the words were of grey static, igniting as if they were in the midst of disappearing. They flickered in silver for a few seconds, then a foreign name appeared in red, the font was the same but it replaced Emma’s silver static name. 
Esther Rose Sullen.
Ner read it. Then the red font and the silver digital font both disappeared into nothingness, indicating that Emma Dove had officially died today at 05:17 AM, but she had not died by the hands of Death nor the Son of Death but by Alistair Quinn, the undead abomination.
Something twinged within Ner, it was his chest again. The tiny scrap of Henry Dale’s bone reacting inside him, the bone throbbed against his chest and Ner began to pant, gripping his chest trying to soothe the pain. But it would not stop, it kept pounding verifying its existence. Then suddenly, it decided to cease. Something strange was happening to Ner, he was not afraid. He couldn’t be, he was Death’s Son, the only feeling or emotion that he had, if you could call it that, was the interest in studying and discovering the reason for this occurring.
“Who is Esther Rose Sullen?” Ner asked, finding a new purpose to his mission.
Griffin was spent, he almost collapsed on the bed as he sat next to Emma’s dead body, “Esther Rose Sullen is Emma Dove.” Griffin plainly stated, staring at his sister, “They have the same body, Emma is likely to be the reincarnated version of her even though their personalities are different, the face, the hair every physical characteristic are the same.” Griffin opened the end table drawer and found a bottle of tequila within it, he opened the cap and drank, gulping down quarter of the bottle, “She was my sister, Alistair’s soul mate but now she’s just,” He paused, taking another gulp, “Dead.”
“Your sister?” Ner asked, not surprised at all.
“Aren’t you supposed to know all this?” Griffin asked incredulously instead of answering.
Ner ignored Griffin’s question by asking one of his own, “What was Alistair’s intention?”
“He wanted to bring her back. He wanted Esther back, we all wanted Esther back in the past but I came to accept it, my family died in acceptance of it. But that damned selfish bastard, he never did.” Griffin swung the bottle to his lips, emptying the contents, “Second chances never happen.” Griffin threw the bottle down and finally collapsed his body next to Emma’s. He stared at the ceiling then closed his eyes, shunning the presence of the Son of Death, he did not care if the Son of Death would take his life and was hoping that Ner actually would. A heavy silence controlled the room for a few minutes then a slight incoherent sigh was heard from the lips of the dead female.
Ner followed the sound and observed Emma Dove swaying her head as if she was having a nightmare, she tossed her head from one side to the other. Ner’s brain verified him of the definition of dead being,
‘A previous living vessel that is no longer able to receive life due to activities such as murder, electrocution, poison, slaughter, drowning. These activities are not limited to these.’ 
“Electrocution,” Ner said the word and he highlighted it in red as a warning. His brain then continued the description of the dead being,
‘...The vessel will be unable to communicate in any form, this entails conversing and any potential movement on its own.’
Ner heard Emma moan and saw her head shift on the pillow. “Conversing and movement.” Ner analysed, highlighting the second warning.
He tapped the gold Clock for official third independent assurance and confirmation of the warnings he had highlighted. He waited for her personal profile to pop up and appear but, instead of the expected black font, nothing appeared. On top of Emma Dove’s shifting head, the only visible object was the wooden headboard of the bed.
This implied, actually it evidently proved that the living Emma Dove had died at 05:17 AM and had become an undead being at 05:25 AM, for the first time in his entire existence, the Son of Death knew he felt something that was definitely an emotion. He did not try to deny it, the feeling rose from his feet to his head and he heard his feet ask his head about the emotion his body was feeling and his head responded,
Dread. 
Dread faced him in this moment and for some unknown and logical reason he knew it would win. He waited for the moment to pass, waiting for his brain to search and analyse the most advantageous solution to this problem and indeed it came, it knocked hard at his empty chest, as his brain made him conclude the only solution that was feasible was to erase and delete Emma Dove’s entire existence.

THE END
