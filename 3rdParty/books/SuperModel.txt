SuperModel
2014 03
A young girl decides to fasttrack her model ambition and finds herself thrust in a world she is not quite ready for. She discovers an unusual ally who sends her into situations she would not normally go.



This is the story of a girl. Not an ordinary girl, but not a pretty girl either. She was one given the rare genetic trait of interestingness. This girl never felt beautiful, no man could lie to those interesting features and call them lovely or pretty or beautiful or any of those words, nor could another women find any reason to be jealous of her. At first glance quite ordinary, but at second and third glance this creature climbed into the brain and stayed there.

Sleep. Her mind drifted between consciousness and dreams, the real world was a faraway place. In the distance a train rattled and blew a solemn note. The sound wove itself into her dream and cast her in the lead role - a delicate girl desperately trying to escape the oncoming locomotive. The train was closer. She ran faster. A tunnel. An alarm. She felt the buzzing through the floor. 
"Fuck. Off." Amanda Bailley slapped the snooze button. "Ow." She hated alarms and everything they represented. How long had it been ringing? She forced one eye open. The glowing numbers on the alarm looked wrong. 7:30. Ohshitfuckityfuckit. Work. No time to wash hair. Cannotbelateagaincannotbelateagain. This was going to be one of those days. She pulled on her clothes, hastily ripped off the night before by her drunken boyfriend, while his snores rose from underneath the covers. My steam train, she thought. It had been a wild night. Mutual rape. His clothes were lying tangled in hers. She put on his shirt, 4 sizes too big for her. 

Waitressing. Amanda stood in front of the customer, her awkwardly thin frame towering over his bald, fat head, her blonde hair (Strawberry Blonde #54, £16.99) coming loose around her neck, the heat in the restaurant intensifying her blush.
"Rare." His mouth was half full of garbage. "It's not fucking complicated. I asked for it rare." The customer, the bald pig, grabbed her hand and pressed the fleshy part between her thumb and forefinger. "Like that, got it, sugarcakes?" His grip lingered. Amanda pulled her hand out of his pudgy grip and grabbed the plate from the table. She watched in horror as the medium steak and potato salad with beetroot in a light vinegraite, £9.99, toppled onto the fat man's lap. She tried to verbalise an apology but her mind stood paralysed in that moment. 
"You fucking ... stupid ...cow!" This was going to get bad. Worse. Bald fat man, sociopath at your service, face turning a shade of beetroot with a light vinegraite. "You stupid, skinny bitch!" He obviously needed to describe her features loudly in case the pedestrians outside were hard of hearing. Amanda did the only thing she could think of - she ran for the hot safety of the kitchen. Behind her the customer's wife, Mrs F. Pig, a woman so covered in makeup and filled with Botox she would crack if she smiled, asked her husband, "What is wrong with her lips?" Irony, thy name is Revlon. Their kid, a little piglet who would grow up to be the CEO of a pharmaceutical company that sold drugs to kids, laughed and said, "She has funny ears. Dad, did you see her ears?"
At the back of the kitchen was her happy place, relatively speaking, a corner with a few boxes and a mop. Me and you, Mr Mop, we are the vagrant twins, soulmates even. We both clean up after pigs. Her hands shook as she dialled her boyfriend, baby tears running down the sides of her phone. Three months work for that phone. Samsung Galaxy S5, £470.00, cash. No contracts for me, Mr Man, I am off the grid. "Please come and get me." Three months work for that boyfriend, James Jason Jones, stupid name, value unknown. Save me, Jay, and while you're at it pretend I don't need saving, good boy.

The building where Amanda grew up had not changed in a hundred years. It was ratty and the paint was peeling, but the rent was cheap. Amanda ran up the three flights to the tiny flat where she and her mom lived. Her mom sat at the kitchen table with a glass of whiskey and a magazine, breathing heavily. She was a large woman, built for comfort not speed, she would say.
"Did you get my fags?" Hi mom, how was your day. 
"No."
"'Fuck sakes, child. How many times have I told you?" Amanda wondered how other mothers talked when their little girls got home. Did you have a good day at work, my darling? No, mummy, I murdered a pig in cold blood and then killed his plastic wife. Sorry, my baby, these things happen and tomorrow will be better. Thank you, mommy.
Amanda went to her room and hid behind the door, out of throwing range. Through the slit in the door she yelled "I quit my job!" This was a brave act; iminent war could ravage the quiet Flatland. A moment's silence for the brave fallen. The moment lingered, many months of struggle and arguments and hypocrisy on her side and her mother's side were tangled in it.
"Are you stupid? Are you actually joking with me right now, Amanda Lorrain? You know we don't have money! We don't even have coffee!"
"I know. I'm sorry. But I'm going to the modeling agency I told you about. I saw another ad saying that they're looking for models. I'll get work." It was a sign. A magazine just happened to be under Jay's bed. Okay, a lame sports magazine, but still. God works in mysterious ways. When one door closes another opens, right? And guys were always telling her she should be a model.
"You, a model?" Her mom gave a snort. "Don't make me laugh. You couldn't get a modeling job, you're too short and your boobs are so small you don't even need a bra. Tiny." She watched through the slit at her mom's hand gestures illustrating Amanda's disability. Thanks mom, always my rock, my pillar. My support.
"Where must I get my fags now? I can't ask Merris for more, she's already shitty with me. You make me mad you do. Did you apologise? Go back and beg them to take you back." Wait, what? Her mother always assumed she was the problem. Okay, maybe sometimes Amanda ended up on the wrong side of town or maybe she went out too much, or failed too many stupid school assignments because she was slacking off, but Amanda wanted the benefit of the doubt at least some of the time. Her mother told everyone how to solve their problems and this left her friendless. Most days she sat in the kitchen watching soap operas and cooking shows smoking her lungs out. Other people's problems were always so easy to solve. Go back to the restaurant and beg, just like that. It wasn't that easy. There was no way Amanda could go back. Until she got another job quickly the next few weeks would be spent avoiding the landlord and dealing with the awkwardness of not paying bills for a while. No big deal. Not the first time. Let me be the one to douse the flames then. "I'm sorry, mom, I just don't think I can carry on there."
"No, you don't think, that's your problem. You're fucking stupid, that's your problem. Maybe if you paid attention in school we wouldn't be in this mess." It might have been true, she had quit school in the final year, 3 months before final exams. She knew she was going to fail. She knew she didn't have the determination to study, not like the others. School was hard, it was full of intelligent, sporty people and they all seemed to know what to do. But school was torture. It was also filled with bullies and people with prospects and judgement. Amanda was lost, she stumbled around trying to make sense of the world. She hated it most times. Her father was nowhere, a bum somewhere living off disability and brandy. Usually borrowed from a neighbour. Borrow in the way that most of the brandy was returned down the plumbing, or the sink if there wasn't time. Sometimes he returned the brandy to the floor where a good daughter would clean it up. He wasn't a bad man, just a little fucked up. Who wasn't?
They say there are only seven kinds of people in the world. Perhaps she was destined to meet the same one over and over. Jay wasn't like her father, was he? Her stomach growled. She usually took food from the plates at the restaurant, even though it was against the law or something. Fuck that shit, good food is good food. Maybe she could make something. "Are there any eggs?" Silence from mother of the year too busy taking a drag from her last cigarette. No food, no luxuries. Just fags and fat. How the hell does she put on so much weight? Amanda's mobile phone had drained her savings. If her mom found out about the phone she would end up murdered in her bed, strangled with the charger. But it was an escape. Something to do. A way to talk to Jason. 
Who else did she actually know? Some old guy she had modeled for a few months ago, but it had departed from modeling and now and again she danced topless for him in his flat for spare cash. Dodgy old man, but sweet in his own way. A sort of annoying friendship. Was that really it? All her friends from school had moved on, married, careers. Fuck, I don't even know what I want to be yet. The universe was quiet on this big question.
Mother finally looked up from her magazine. "No there are no fucking eggs. Go ask that Jay for eggs." Hey boyfriend didn't have eggs. She had just come from there. Empty fridge. No money. Fuck, I'm hungry. She would have to use someone for dinner. She'd seen it done a million times at the pub. She went to her room and threw on a black dress, Dolce & Gabanna, £139.97. Okay, let's be honest, Xian Lee, £12.00, knockoff. A few hours at the pub would get her free drinks, let's see if she could get a dinner as well. But something inside reminded her she was too shy. She wanted to follow the rules, but the rules made life hard. She wanted to be a bad girl but that meant dealing with people. She though of Jay. I don't know what to do to succeed. Jay doesn't know either, useless sod. But she was hungry. 
"I'm going out." She had to try for supper. Save up her nutrition for future nights without it. It was a game she played with her mind, let's see who gives in first.
"Like hell you are. You need to make me dinner." Amanda opened the front door. "Where are you going?" How can I make you dinner if there is no food, you stupid cow.
"Jesus, I'm just going out!" Fuck this shit. Fuck Eggs. Fuck you. 
"Don't you take the good Lord's name in vain, young lady. If you go out that door you better find another place to live. I bloody mean it this time! I'm sick of your shit!" Amanda's blood boiled. This day had been the worst ever.
"Jesus, mom, you do nothing! I'm the only one trying here! I feed you, I clean for you, it's supposed to be the other way around! You know what? Fuck you, then!" Amanda flipped her mom the bird and ran down the stairs into the welcoming anonymity of the city streets. She had never sworn at her mom before. There was something final about it.

No free suppers appeared that night. Or the next night. But there was food, her dirty old man friend could be persuaded to buy her pizza and beer, which she devoured topless while he watched her eat. He was usually the hungry one and he wanted more. Getting fondled for cash was better than serving pigs. But he was harmless, actually, always made her laugh with his funny face and stupid jokes. She could probably beat him up, poor thing. She left the old man and slept at Jay's place. They looked for jobs on the internet. Nothing happened. She knew her mom went to Weight-Watchers every Thursday and she and Jay snuck in and moved her stuff out. 

Jay's place. Heavy metal and weed. Shitty furniture stained with spilt beer and cigarettes. Amanda carried her suitcase into the flat and at once it was awkward. She was drunk. He was high. She could tell he didn't want her in his space. Guys needed space. Fuck space. They were always two beers away from an argument. There were puke stains on the carpet and a dead plant on the windowsill. The flat smelled of fart. Amanda got used to it. It was paradise compared to the emotional torture of home.

There were some good times. One day when Jay was out Amanda turned the little kitchen into a photo studio. Jay's camera, Canon EOS55D, 50mm Prime Lens, £280.80 New. Amanda bought it for his birthday soon after they met. So fucking expensive, it cost all her savings at the time. He had chatted her up at a bar a year ago and one night he told her he wanted to be a famous photographer and he wanted to photograph her forever. If only he had a camera. Such a corny line. Naturally she fell in love with him and bought him the camera a week later. He used it only once, to take naked photos of her. Douchebag. Still, it was better to be in a boring relationship with an attractive guy than in an interesting relationship with an ugly guy, right? He just kept the naked photos on his laptop. He never looked at them. Asshole. He didn't even jerk off to them. Guys are all the same. Stupid, sniffling dogs always after one thing - ownership. And when they get it they don't want it anymore. They want you to throw it again so they can go and fetch it again, stupid boys. Girls were cats, they existed to preen and be looked after. In exchange you got to feel their sleekness and murderous physique. A machine honed to kill. It was nature's way. 
Jay was at an interview for a lame warehouse job and she was alone in the small kitchen. The light diffusing through the old wooden shutters was magical. 
Her photoshoot was epic. Macaroni earrings, tinfoil dress, flour and icing-sugar for makeup. A collar made from cardboard torn from a box Jay used to keep some of his personal stuff together and to hide his weed. Guys had stuff in boxes. Girls had things in cupboards. Stuff and things do not look good on the same shelf. 
Her photos were art. Fuck you, Damien Hirst, sick fuck. Fuck off Terry Richardson you sexy perv and fuck you, especially, Annie Leibovitz. Jesus, she loved their art. They made mind porn with designer clothes. Artifical and trite and over the top. Fuck yes. Amanda had macaroni and a camera and lingerie (Marks & Spencer Easy Tease, £12.40), and a pirated version of Photoshop. It was enough for now.

2 Days later.
A small morning argument with Jay as usual. Her savings were dwindling. A bus trip into town to the agency. £1.50. 
It was a busy little office. The busy little woman in a stiff suit on the other side of the desk looked at the pink form Amanda was filling out. Amanda smiled and tried to look professional. It was like a hostage negotiation, the first one who speaks loses.
"I was just wondering", Amanda's voice was a squeek, "when I will get paid." She had on the Lloyd Rose boots, pink Chase top and a slutty little skirt that was worth many, many Vodka and Red Bulls if used correctly. Too bad the agent was a woman, clearly very married with kids, judging by the photo on her desk and the permed hair and fake earrings. (£2.20 Cash & Carry, authentic.)
A lingering pause. A genuine look of incredulity on the woman's face. "What?" The little plaque on her desk said 'Clear, Inc Models - the choice is Clear' in fake gold and fake wood. Her glasses slid down to the end of her nose. "I can't send you out. You don't have a portfolio yet and you don't have experience." The model's catch-22. Can't get one without the other.
"I know, but I thought you could help me with that, you know, get me started. I'd really appreciate it." Amanda gave a tired smile.
Amanda suspected the dragon lady might be the bald restaurant man's mistress. Or sister. Or both. The dragon's eyes rolled and Amanda died a little inside. "Look at that board", the dragon poked her pen at a squad of photos on the pinboard next to her table, a little red dot now on the forehead of some incredibly gorgeous girl. Miss India. Above her another 100 or more portraits of pretty girls stared out with sultry iciness. They were all arranged in rows like good little girls with neatly trimmed vaginas, you know, because they were decent girls. Scratch that, they probably had Brazillians paid for by wonderful aunts. Mrs Dragon pinned Amanda's photo to the board at the end of the bottom row.  "You see that red line?" She pointed at the line half way up the board, drawn a few times in that annoying red pen. "That's the earning line. You," she looked down at the form, "Amanda," she looked up again, "are here." She tapped Amanda's photo at the bottom end of the board, leaving three red dots on her face. The voodoo pen made Amanda's nose itch. Now we are sisters, Amanda thought, Miss Smallpox and Miss India. Baptised in the blood of dragons. But that photo, taken hastily in front of a white cloth in the lobby by the receptionist, made Amanda uneasy. My first professional photo shoot, sortof. Next to all the others she looked like a frightened schoolgirl. A deer in the headlights. A stupid girl with no dad and an untrimmed vagina.
Amanda looked away. Look at the floor. Look at the wall. Just don't look at that board. There were photos everywhere. Goddesses stared at her. Black and white Dior ads signed in thick marker. Dear Xyz, thank you, from Perfect Model #270. Fashion and beauty magazines lay open in untidy and precisely placed perfection showing off the agency's product, the model. Always the agency model. We run this town, the ads said. We own you. You owe us. On the opposite wall a photo of a 36C goddess in a miraculous Versace dress sitting on a golden couch covered in silk by the studio of Oscar de la Renta. That couch would cost more than Amanda. Stupid, skinny Amanda.
"Who took that?" Anything to stop tears.
The dragon paused her huffing and puffing and peered over her glasses. "That is a Zenith, taken for Versace 2 years ago. If you get to the top of the board you might get to work with him." She stressed the might as if there was actual hope. Amanda still had to pay the registration fee, and this felt like bait. She heard most agencies preyed on the hopes and dreams of naive young girls. Naive being a french word for stupid. Stupid young Amandas, all in a row with spots on their nose and empty wallets. But that photo on the wall compared to her photo...
"It's beau..."
The phone on her agent's desk rang and she waved Amanda to be quiet.
"What? Ok, send her in." She peered at Amanda over her glasses. "I have another appointment. We'll let you know." She shuffled Amanda's form into the big pile of identical forms, took Amanda's photo from the board and paperclipped it to the wrong form. Amanda didn't correct her. The dragon stood up indicating the interview was at an end. Amanda stayed down. The form sat on the dragon's desk, covered in red pen. It may as well be in the bin. Knees finally waking Amanda blushed and stood up. The most beautiful woman she had ever seen floated in - a hundred feet tall, hair as red as blood, dripping with jewellery and perfume, Dior Sepulturac, £59.90 per fluid ounce. More expensive than blood. More expensive than even inkjet ink. She wore a a Holbein mink guaranteed to have made at least 20 animals suffer in its creation (£620.00) . Jimmy Chus. Stockholm and Sons stockings. Priceless earrings. That heavenly perfume, it smelled like virgin blood and daffodils and success. I hate her. Amanda nodded and smiled in greeting, but the goddess looked through her and gave the dragon a fake French embrace and double air-kisses. 
"Did you get my shoot?" No greeting, but Dragons don't care for manners, gold is king in the dragon's den. Amanda looked back to the wall. It was her, the woman in the poster. Miss Perfect. Miss Impossible. Miss big tits and tiny waist.
"Of course I did. But I tell you it was not an easy task, you know the man doesn't do digital." Zenith. They were talking about Zenith. "I have all the details here. She tapped a sealed envelope on the desk, a stamp of gold foil proved its worth. But let's go have a coffee first." They laughed in unison and walked out. Fakes. Frauds. Amanda saw through them both. Amanda was invisible, it was her super-power. She looked around to make sure no one was coming, grabbed the envelope with the gold stamp, and ran for the door.

Amanda walked down high street, feeling thoroughly outclassed by the suits and ties. And beards. And women who had careers and not jobs. Yesterday Amanda saw something important in Elle Magazine and now she turned into an alley to find the advertised store. Everyone needs a pretty hat, the ad said, and it was indeed a very pretty example of the species sitting so alluring in the window. The seams were perfect French stitching, contours starched, Ukrainian felt so delicate and refined the company went bankrupt to produce it just before the Russians invaded, no doubt to get hold of the felt. Luckily savvy workers had smuggled a few meters out and the felt had found itself here. The ad said. She checked her purse. She could make it, and this hat was clearly a sign, put there for a reason. It would sway him when he saw her waltzing past in such style. It would go perfectly with the shoes she had permanently in her bag, the ones she never dared wear. They were her millionaire shoes, in case she met one she would slip them on, and maybe the millionaire would slip them off later.
She sensed more than saw the beggar walking towards her, he turned and stopped next to her at the window. He smelled of urine and meths and a haunting childhood.
"Spare change, lady?" Amanda shook her head, hoping he would go away. Go and tell someone else your story, your excuse. He walked closer and she turned towards the shop window, cutting off all communication. She felt the pressure of his hand fondling her bottom. Jesus, fuck.
"Don't touch me!" Amanda pulled herself away, but the man, dressed in the putrid rags (£0.00 Trash and Trailer), grinned toothlessly and pushed forward. She could smell his methylated breath reach up to her neck. She was paralysed. She could smell his body's perfume - Paralysis by Calvin Klein. Give It To Her.
"Just a little love, my darling. You and me." He reached for her breast and she jerked away.
"Fuck off!" but the man was not deterred and edged closer. He grabbed her wrist and Amanda struggled against his iron grip, honed in a thousand street fights. A woman shouted from the boutique behind her and the beggar let go. Amanda raced into the safety of the dimly lit fashion temple. Ah sweet, safe home. A place to find the meaning of life. And she happened to be there. A sign. She smiled a thank you at the shopkeeper, a stout girl in a leather dress who went back to folding pants. Amanda looked around at the amazing clothes, she wanted it all, maybe she would even wear all of it. This was style, this was class, not the high street straight cut shit they made in twelve sizes. This was for real girls, desperate girls, girls like her. Forgive me father, for I am thin. Skinny girls gave their confession in the dressing room every day and walked out feeling guilty if they didn't buy something. It was the only boutique with a purge bucket in the restroom, some said. Say three Hail Mary's and a Christian Delecroix. Why yes we do take Mastercard, thank you, come again, fake smile. Outside, the ragman muttered to himself and humped off. Amanda stood near the counter and put on the darling hat and picked up a pair of fake sunglasses from a revolving display. The man faded away; the coast was clear. She put down the sunglasses and walked out. The wind was blowing and the hat almost flew away. Just a little too big for her empty head. Amanda took out her winter woolly hat with the floppy ears (Flea Market Fun £2) and put it on. She put on the beautiful new hat over that. Perfect fit.
"Hey!" a shout from... where? Was he coming back?
Amanda held her new, pretty hat and ran for the safety of the waiting bus. Perfect timing. Another sign. She gave the last of her money to the driver and staggered to a seat as the bus pulled off with the precision driving skills no doubt learned at a terrorist training camp. Fuck! The Hat. It was under her trembling fingers. Oh shit. Oh Fuck. I am Thief. I am Sin. I'll go back and pay for it, she lied. There was no money left. This was it.

The road up to Newburg was a steep climb, and the bus was labouring. They pulled up at a stop. The driver gestured at her to get out.
"I need to get to the top." It sounded corny, and the driver had no interest in the needs of aspiring models.
"I'm turning around here." He wore a cheap brown suit and vague expression. Fuck you, stupid driver. "Thank you." Amanda got off and adjusted her bag. Her bag of infinite magic, Givenchy £61.50. Knockoff. But still genius. She found her lip-ice and applied it like a magic strength potion. The road up the hill went on forever. She started to walk. Her cheap sneakers were not designed for walking, but for partying. A light breeze sprung up and she was glad for the air conditioning. She rehearsed her introduction a dozen times, how she'd hold out her hand and then pull out her wad of research and impress him with her knowledge of his work. He would see she was a serious contender. He would fall in love, he would give her money, it was meant to be.
Half an hour later she saw the crest of the road, but the sweat was everywhere. Better stop and cool off. She pulled out the packet. More stolen goods. Contraband. On the cover in gold print - Clear, Inc. She had been through it a dozen times, just a sheet with an address and a few sketches. And a black and white photo on actual paper, when was the last time she had seen that? A Zenith. That magical address. That ray of hope. An escape from a maxed out credit card and no job and an eviction notice from a landlord who didn't like metal played at midnight and weed smoked at breakfast.

This was not a good day, but at least it couldn't get any worse. At the top of the hill was a stone wall and an iron gate and old leaves over everything. A photoshoot waiting to happen. As she reached the gate the breeze picked up and blew her new hat into the garden. 
"No!" She ran after it as it rolled away, obvlivious to the ground underneat. Her sneakers caught in the ivy on the ground and she fell, hands into soft and messy dirt. The hat rolled and stopped at the feet of a big sweaty man pulling weeds from a bed of roses. He turned and saw the hat and the sweaty girl, picked it up and held it out to her. Great, me in my woolly hat, you in your... work clothes? She plucked the hat away and ran back to the gate. He followed her. Not this again. She hated confrontations.
"Are you alright, jelly bean?" He shouted after her. This was the right place. He must be the gardener. 
"Would you mind calling your boss?" Amanda shouted back. And sat down on the edge of the little stone flowerbed, exhausted. She had scuff marks on her palms from the fall and her hat was ruined. Her magic hat. Why did I sit down now? And now she was crying. Oh great.
"I'm afraid I don't have a boss." He was walking over. Realisation dawned on Amanda. 
"Oh." Oh. Oh shit. Him. It must be. He was strange. An island shirt so out of fashion it was cool. She couldn't put his features into context. "Sorry. I'm not having a very good day." Tears, thank you for coming at the worst and most embarassing moment in human history. "Are you Zen?"
"Hmm, yes. Are you looking for me?" He was a middle-aged man with greying hair and a belly and that mesmerising island shirt. She blushed. He held out his hand. "Do you need a cup of tea, jelly bean?"
"Yes, please." She almost said sir.

He made them tea and piled a few scones onto an antique plate. It was a quaint kitchen, an old house with a new guest. She still had her bag. Tea in one hand, bag in the other. Good old dependable bag. Givenchy. £61.50. Still a Knockoff. 
"Oh!" The plan. The old razzle dazzle, the sales pitch. She pulled out her bundle of research and thrust it at him, the nerves bunching up in her throat. He peered at her over his glasses as they walked down the stony corridor, he was carrying the hat. Shit. My hat. Her woolly hat with the floppy ears tickled her face.
"Um, you did that." She shook the pages at him. He took them and adjusted his glasses. She handed over a magazine. "And that is beautiful," stabbing her finger at an ad in an authoratitive manner. "And that. Um, and this. I love this so much." She realised he couldn't see what she was looking at and she tilted the pages to him.
He took it from her and adjusted his glasses again. "That one is quite pretty," he said, "but the camera did all the hard work."
"I don't think so, you're a genius, don't you know!"
"Nonsense, anyone with a camera can do it."
"Hardly!" Amanda heard her voice get high pitched. I am rat. "And I figured out what it is. Your secret. Look, all the models. In all the photos. They all pose the same way. Different, I mean, unique, but the same. Perfectly." He lifted an eyebrow at her. She swallowed hard and continued. "Like ballet. But when I saw them in other photographer's works they're real clods, you know? You did that. You made those moments. You made them. That's why I'm here."
"You want to be a photographer?"
Yes. "No! A model. I want you to teach me how to model. Like that. I've seen every photo you've ever done. Brilliant. I mean if you have time. If I could do that I'd be unstoppable." 
"I see."
"I mean, I want to work for you. If you need a model. And you can teach me modeling. If you wanted." Her voice trailed off. Amanda frowned at the realisation of her impossible request. His walls were lined with photos. Great, great, photos. And a few paintings. He was so talented it hurt her mind to think of it. There must be millions of models dying to work with him. Professional models. Tall models. His inbox must be stuffed. "It's harder than I thought. And I need the money."
"Oh, you mean you want money. Oh I see. Well you seem to know an awful lot about me. Are you stalking me?" She couldn't tell if Zenith was serious or not. His face, unlike his work, had no emotion.
"No! It's just... your work is so fucking beautiful." He laughed. Amanda died quietly inside. Fuck. "Sorry. My language. But the way you see women. That's how I want to be seen." No response. "One day." If you'll let me. Please let me. She pointed at her favourite - a dark image of a strange,  beautiful girl in a broken room surrounded by water. As calm as a tsunami. An owl perched on the sofa staring at the girl and she knew what it was feeling. The light. The mood. The magic. "And this one." She reached for a magazine. She was calm now, maybe she could tell him about the signs. How she felt it was destined and she was guided to be here at this point in history by a greater force. She reached for her diary but the gods of her fingers intervened and to her horror her fingers gave out from the nerves and she dropped the stack of papers and sketches and magazines onto the floor, pages and notes cascading down in a waterfall of fashion and photography. The cup of tea followed. And a scone landed jam side down. Of course it would. The scone and the wet, sloppy, tea. Splat. A dripping mess of research and cutouts and sketches done late at night that she hadn't shown him because suddenly she realised he would not be short of ideas. He did not need her. She needed him. He was infinite. He was Zen. There was a moment of intake. And he sighed. She started to cry. Not little girl manipulative crying, but face-contorted spontaneous lips-out baby crying. Stupid girl standing in her mess. She covered her face and walked away. It was the most humiliating moment in her life.

"Sorry. this wasn't what I expected." She was sitting on a chair outside the kitchen looking into the corner and he was remaking the tea. It was awkward. Tears were dried up. Pathetic. Plumber, heal thyself.
"You were expecting a tall thin man with a ponytail and stubble who lives in a grand palace," he said over his shoulder.
"No, not that. " Maybe something like that. A fairy tale. "This place is perfect. I just thought this would all go smoothly for once."
"Had a rough time lately?" Amanda looked around at the small,  interesting home. A nice little house on top of the hill. Outside the window was a view of the whole world. She had not often been in a home with a view, or in a house for that matter.
"You have no idea." Amanda's gaze caught on a photo on the wall, an impossibly tall woman alone in the ruins. The woman wore a slip of gold fabric that accentuated every part of her perfect body.
"Is pretty girl in abandoned building your favourite theme?" That sounded like judgement. Please please don't take it the wrong way.
"Yes." His head poked through the kitchen doorway and he grinned. "Sometimes when I'm bored I do abandoned girl in pretty building, works just as well."
Amanda grinned back. This was surreal, disconnected, the events around her were flowing with her thoughts.
She walked into the hall, on the wall was a large poster. "Who is she?" 
"Theresa Beinhardt," Zen shouted from the kitchen, "currently at Wilhelmina. Haven't seen her in years." He emerged carrying a fresh tray of tea and cookies. "Come on, let's go sit in the lounge. The lighting is better."

She was shaking and the cup was rattling. There was a little chip in the saucer; the saucer had a little picture of a forest on it. Like someone's grandma would have. She gave him a thin smile. Why am I so fucking insanely nervous? "I'm a little nervous." On the saucer sat a little cookie, she put it into her mouth. It tasted of caramel and nutmeg and real butter. So fucking delicious. Especially after weeks of noodles and polony. Or was it months now? Time had become a strange concept. She was shaking again. A terrified puppy at the vet. Please fix me, master Zen.
"Would you prefer a plastic cup?" She winced at his joke; nothing to him but it cut her deeply. Oh fucking great, here comes the tears again. Falling on my face like a melody. Her face scrunched up uncontrollably and her eyes burst forth their glorious sweet stupid summer shower. Idiot. Pathetic baby. Go cry yourself to sleep, stupid baby.
"Please don't look at me. She covered her face to hide the tears.
"Bit difficult, you being a model and all."
"Please stop making jokes."
"I can't, it's my super-power." The cying stopped. They sat in silence for a while. Her phone buzzed, she ignored it. It would be Jay. Not now, sweetheart.
"So how does it work? Becoming a model I mean." Please tell me the shortcut, please please oh please, I have to know.
"I won't say join an agency and everything will work out, because it won't. And I won't say work hard because that doesn't matter if you work in the wrong way. I guess if there is a secret formula it is this...do what you're told. Most models lose their way when they try to contol the process. They forget they're working with artists with big egos. There are a lot of egos in the industry, everyone wants to be the creator." It sort of made sense.
"So, what must I do?"
"Can you follow instructions?" Amanda nodded.
"Yes."
"Can you walk?" 
"Yes. I don't know. What do you mean?"
"Can you command a room when you move? Have all eyes focus on you. Manipulate people. Mesmerize them. Can you do that?"
"I don't know." Manipulate, yes, mesmerize, no.
"Well let's find out. Stand up." Amanda put down her magical cup of tea and stood up. Follow instructions. I can do that.
"Can you show me your body?" Yes, I can do that. She turned on the spot. "Like this?"
"I mean I want to see what your body looks like. Can you take off your clothes?" Yes I can, it's not hard. She took off her jacket. Ok, Amanda, why exactly am I wearing these horrible patterned leggings? Did I really think it was stylish compared to the gold dresses and velvet? No. Okay. Fine.
"Must I ..." she gestured at her shirt. £21.70 Ulrecht and Creole. Knockoff. He nodded. Okay, no problem, obviously he would need to see her body, duh. He was an artist. Amanda took off her shirt and shoes, unzipped and unwrapped her dress, and stood in her underwear. 
"Everything." Jesus. Ok, standard procedure, I guess. A moment's hesitation. Stop that. Follow instructions. This is a test. A job interview. She tried to smile without revealing her nerves.
"Sorry, I don't know how it works." She took off her bra and slid her panties down praying they would not tangle on her big feet. She observed herself from far away, shaking. Fuck! Her shoes. Adidas sneakers. 100 Fucking pounds, now messed up and dirty. She struggled to get the panties over. She tried to make it look smooth. It wasn't. Don't fall. Don't you dare fucking fall. Aha! The panties were off. Victory! She twirled around in her shoes, feeling extra naked. Strangely she did not feel afraid of him. His reputation preceded him. Well, his art. It was a declaration of peace to the world. She was safe. The shaking was gone. It was the transition to nakedness that was nerve wracking. The fear of getting in trouble. He had a calm aura. Aptly named you are, master Zen. I am one with the universe. 
"Good." Zen sat back and sipped his drink, "Can you walk to that far wall and back?" Yes, sir, I can do that. 
Amanda, at least grown up Amanda, had never been naked in front of anyone except her boyfriend before. Okay, that old guy in town for private dancing, but that was different, that was dinner. It wasn't unpleasant being naked, just... unusual. Amanda had no issues with her body. It was a thing her mind rode to get to work and clubs. A vehicle. Sometimes a vessel. She reached the wall, touched it, turned around. It was a new sensation. Please don't get wet, she thought. Turn off that terrible tap. Fuck. A little dampness. Nothing visible, she hoped. She leaked everwhere, cracked broken girl. Who would want a cracked broken girl?
"Walk back." She obeyed. 
"Turn around." She turned around as she got to him. He sat there looking at her back for what felt like forever. She shifted weight and looked back over her shoulder trying to see what he was looking at. Her ass? Her legs? Awkward. Awkward. Awkward. He scratched his beard. He had a beard, she hadn't noticed before. He was actually quite ugly. Not unpleasant, just... weird. Unconventional. Somehow this seemed important. Perhaps an attractive man wouldn't appreciate a female's body so much. A gym jock would fuck and forget her before he got to the golf course. Here was supply and demand, economics 101. She watched his eyes looking at every part of her. He was enjoying the show.
"I tell you what, since you are so ambitious, I'm shooting the cover of Teen Queen next month. I want to use you." 
It took a few moments for the voice to reach her consciousness. Who said that? Amanda came back to reality. What? Seriously? Don't freak out don't freak out don't freak out.
"Okay." Tell me everything. Slowly.
"You'll need a lot of training though." Was he offering to train her too? No effing eff way. Training. Like a ninja, can't see me, just feel my blade when I'm gone.
"And be obedient. Follow instructions. No bullshit."
"I can do that." Yes, I can do that. What was his deal anyway? Straight, Gay, Bi, what? Ok, definitely straight. A bit pervy. This was weird, but... ok.
"Turn around and walk to the wall again." She did as she was told. Good girl. Obedient. Ninja. She turned. 
"Walk back." She did. "You need a lot of work. You have no idea how to walk, your muscles are all over the place." His face was deadpan. No emotion. What was he thinking?
"I know. Sorry." Stop saying sorry, stupid cow. You are lame. She remembered her ballet teacher in grade school. You walk like a duck, she had told Amanda. Everything sticks at that age. Amanda quit ballet after than. Ducks don't do ballet, swans do ballet.
"And again." Again? What the fuck. She rolled her eyes and turned. "Turn back. This time try it without the attitude." She stopped in her tracks, blood rushing into her face. He sees everything. Every hair. Every pimple and every eyelash. Every unshaved vagina. Why hadn't she trimmed her bush? "Do what I say, no attitude, no bullshit. Then you get the cover. It's simple." The cover. Teen Queen. Jesus what an opportunity. A life. He was literally giving her a life. What did he want? Sex? Or what? A Terry Richardson initiation ritual with come on her face and a few slaps on the ass with a wet towel? Or what? Was he even straight? Amanda would do anything at this point. Amanda's phone buzzed in her bag on the couch. Jay. Boyfriend. Light of her life. She walked to her phone and tapped at the screen to reply to the sms, standing naked in the lounge of a man she had meet 20 minutes ago.
"Can you stop that?" Zenith was annoyed. Shit. 
"Sorry." She put the phone down on her clothes. This must be what hookers feel like. It buzzed again. Another message. Fuck my ADD. "He wants to know if I'm okay." My darling, you do care after all. And I shall return victorious with good news.
"No distractions." Amanda seethed quietly. My phone. I worked 3 months for that thing. Fuck you, Zen. Change the subject before I kill you.
"Do you ever date your models?" she heard herself ask in the distance. Nice subtle question there, miss reporter, miss undercover spy without the covers.
"No, I don't date the help." Now his voice was solid, short, final. Amanda was not sure if it was a joke. Blushing fully now she turned away. Shit. Fuck. Okay. Focus. Fuck! What the actual fucking fuck fuck? Now? Now you're wet? She walked to the far wall, dripping down her leg. Get out of his sight. Fuck. A secret wipe. She could hear herself suck-suck like bubble gum. Don't look. Don't look.
"Can I put my clothes on now?" Amanda's small voice floated from across the room.
"No. You'll put them on when I tell you." She was more wet now. Oh why am I so fucked up.
Amanda was dazed. Confused. This is surreal. Scary. Wonderful. Okay, back up a bit. Nothing comes for free. What was in it for him?
"I'll really get the cover?"
"Yes. If you work hard for the next month, you'll be good enough for the cover. You obviously don't have money. There will be expenses. You'll have to work for me."
"Wow. Thank you. This is huge." She had to tell someone. "Can I phone my boyfriend?" I need to survive for one month. Just one. I can do that. We can do that. You and me, baby, are gonna buy a yacht.
"Yes. And break up with him." The words hung in the air. "He's an interruption." Amanda stood analysing the moment, everything that had just happened. "Do what I tell you." A command. The silence grew awkwardly around them. Break up with Jay? Just like that? He had been the only thing keeping her alive for a long time. Big dick Jay. Emotionally unavailable Jay. Slightly stupid Jay. Fuck, he turned her on. 
"If he loves you he'll wait a month. But after the cover you'll be travelling, dating models, men and women, socialising on yachts." 
He said yachts, Amanda thought, the best word in the world. 
"Your boyfriend will hold you back, stop you from meeting the right people." Jesus Christ. People, modeling people. But a cloud in Amanda's brain wouldn't move out the way. I don't know what to do. Love was the most important thing, after all, right? Jay.
"I'm sorry, I can't. I'm really sorry."
"It's a deal-breaker. Me or him." Amanda was confused. What? What did he mean? Was he that arrogant? How could anyone break up with someone for a job? I just met you Zen, and I respect your work, but my integrity is worth more. The tears were back. Was he toying with her? You know what, fuck men. Fuck all of them. Even this one. He was preying on her vulnerability. He wanted to own her. He knew she was desperate and he wanted to destroy her life, then throw her aside when the next pretty little thing came along. Men are all the same. She thought he would be different, just like every girl in the universe thought some new guy was different. Stupid girl. It had been something in his art, something he saw that other men didn't. But it was just the desire of a dirty old man. All the girls in his photos, all vulnerable, pathetic creatures, his prey. She saw him on his couch, enjoying the free strip show. Amanda's illusions shattered.
"I'm really sorry I wasted your time." Tears running down her cheeks. She had almost believed. Almost. Fuck the signs. Fuck God. There is no God. There are just dirty men and young girls. Whoever said slavery was over was not a girl. Her clothes went on a lot quicker than they came off. She avoided eye contact. Her high heels lay next to her bag, her magical shoes. She had wanted to model them for Zen. She thought he would appreciate their majesty, but all he wanted was a stupid cunt. She threw the high heels in her bag and pulled on her sneakers. 
"Amanda, think about compound interest. Where you have to start from. And there are rats out there, Amanda, and they all want you to get tangled up with them, to become a monster king rat. If you leave, fine, but don't ever be a rat." Strange words. Stupid man. His opinions were not important anymore. Dirty, rich fuckhead with his retarded cookies and tea. Amanda pushed open the gate and started the long walk down the hill without saying goodbye. He was standing in the doorway and she felt his eyes follow her. Watch me walk away, asshole. 
"Don't live a rat life." He sounded almost sad, and closed the door.
The town grew bigger as she approached, more ominous. The sun was going down on the other side. She passed a terrible Italian restaurant. Her future. Bad waitress at your service, sir, may I wipe your table for you? Further along some guys in an alley stared at her walking past. Her future. A victim. Or maybe she would let them do whatever they wanted just for something to do. To escape. Past the adult shop. Porn star. They called them stars because they were small and no one knew their names. Above was the strip club. Stripper. No, 'exotic dancer' she would label herself. Burlesque Artiste. Working for tips shaking her pussy at dirty old men. Nothing new. Competing with ever younger girls for the same prize. Dancing for candy. She walked past a homeless guy pissing in his pants. Homeless. One possible future. A rich guy in a sports car stared at her, twenty feet from the homeless guy. This world is fucked up. Rich guy's eyes ran up and down her body. Armani shirt, Dior trousers. A woman had chosen those. His wife. There were marks on his wrists. He liked it rough, but not with his wife. She was his cook, the maid to his kids. He would always want more and he'd be willing to pay. All men were the same. Maybe she would let him. She would take his money. A future John. Just a job. Just rent. Working shifts at the clothing store, helping fat, annoyed bitches get small shoes on their sweaty feet. Stock taking for food. Harassment for rent. Selling drugs for men in alleys. Party till dawn. Pretend her dreams were just meant to be dreams. Let other women talk her out of doing everything worthwhile. Across the road a prostitute was out early looking for someone to pay her bills. Quick cash from a well-dressed ATM or ATM from a poorly dressed loner. Just a job. Getting pissed on for money. Her future, taking chances, bigger risks each time to feel alive. The dirty old man in the damp flat in town who paid cash up front to watch her dance naked. A job. A small reward. Clothes and tampons. Temp jobs for shitty bosses with sports coats and bitchy wives, always getting hit on, some new humiliation to endure every day. A desk job with endless humiliation. Working for a small reward - the luxury of a private bathroom in a private flat. Sacrifice a life just for that. Conditioned each day to accept abuse, just to have a safe place to pee. Some guy leaning over you trying to see down your cheap shirt. Easy Buy. 3.99. Not a knockoff. She would marry Jay the Beautiful Loser with his cliche tribal tattoos and stupid mindless music he though was different from pop because the singers were all angry. He would use the word edgy a lot. Have a retarded kid together, a kid so stupid it would have ADD and need medication to feel normal. But it was not ADD, it was a body's normal retaliation to being in a cage. Small lives. Cages. Jay would cheat when she got wrinkly and self involved, obviously. Boring divorce. Move back in with her aged mom. Pretend everything was okay. Get anorexic and bitter. Smoke until it hurt. Drink until the bitterness left. A blissful suicide. But her mother would say it was heart disease. Lung cancer. AIDS. Something less shameful than bowing out middle aged. 
I fucking hate you. I hate you, you homeless fuck. I hate you, rich sports guy. I hate you, clothing store bitch who will tell me to work harder while you slack off. I hate you, restaurant fucking pigs. I hate all you whores and Johns and dealers and buyers. I hate it all. But I hate me most of all. There is no way out. I am trapped. I am trapped in a trap I made. We are all whores. Less than whores. We are rats. We're stuck in the trap and we will never get enough to climb out. Compound interest. The killer of dreams. The curve was slow to grow. 20 Years of enduring all the world's shit to scrape together enough to buy a shitty little flat. A house if she could pretend Jay's inevitable cheating didn't happen and they could pay down a mortgage selling weed and booze. Endure the loan manager's stupid flirtation. Endure the endless forms that were always the wrong forms just to fuck with her. An endless struggle to survive in a cage with the other rats. But you have to pay for your own cage. Or they put you in another cage with more vicious rats. Extortion.
Amanda saw the world divided in two - the rats, and the people who wore their fur like mink. The world around her moved without her. It did not stop when she stopped. There were no signs. No one giving her hope. No money. No future. I would go home and kill myself, but I have no real home. I am homeless. Oh Jesus fuck, I am homeless. Amanda stood in fear. The fear turned to terror.
The people around her passed in a blur. Cars moved through the streets unaware of her. She stood still on the sidewalk and no one looked at her. The sun went down and nothing changed but the colours. The same rats in darker clothes. We're edgy rats, they would think, we're not like the conformist day rats. They were all filthy rats. She was an invisible girl. Alive or dead, no one would even know. She could fall down right now right here and no one would stop to help. They were too busy being rats looking for the next thing to feed on. In this town the road went on forever, and the people never stopped clawing at the cage. 
She had stopped outside The Fashion Temple, home of fine shoes and bad credit. Amanda's favourite salvation. Boys had video games, girls had shoes. The store had a lazy return policy. And it was open late. A refund on her millionaire shoes would buy supper and she could work the bar a few hours for free drinks. She pulled the precious shoes from her bag and put them on one last time in front of the shop, catching her reflection as she posed. Fuck, she was hot in those shoes. They made her. She moved differently in them. The difference between a hooker and a model is the way they walk. Why did he want to see her walk naked? Why not just ask her to stand there, or dance? She walked a little, feeling her shoes' hatred of her worthless rat feet. Her stupid claws unworthy of their grace. Walking. Why was walking so difficult? Walking said so much about you. About ownership. About worth. Or. What. She looked up the hill. A phantom vibration tingled the pocket of her dress. A cunning hidden pocket sewn in to hide her phone from her mom, even though she was an adult. She was a clever girl. Her phone. Her lifeline. She dialled, her rat claws scratching at the luxurious flat surface of upper-class tech desiged by prissy men in tight turtlenecks and assembled by chinese rats. Something changed in her rat brain for the second time that evening and it made her hesitate for a fraction of time so small and so deep it broke the last piece of her. Please don't answer please don't answer please don't... Jay answered.
"What?"
"Jay?"
He was doing something on the other side. She knew that sound. Sometimes he phoned her from there. He was on the toilet. He groaned into the phone and she heard the splash. She almost threw up.
"We need to talk." I love you, baby, but yachts.

Amanda Lorrain Bailley picked up her bag and walked. The cold and the sweat and the pain did not register. These were worthless sensations she no longer needed. She was caught in the trap. She would kill herself, yes, but she would do it her way. Not die a rat. She walked fast, her calves screamed with pain and she ignored them. A human was not designed to walk in designer heels. That was the point of them. They made you a god. Her legs moved in a ballet, her muscles begged her to stop and take a break but she pressed on faster. The sweat started to drip and she undid her top buttons to cool down. The flow of people around her never stopped. Each person was self involved, walking in circles in the trap. Everyone was a whore. A rat. But she was mink. She would let them wear her only if they could afford it. She hardly noticed the distance.
She strode through the open door to Zen's perfect lounge with its antique and wonderful everything. It was dark outside now, he was sitting next to a crackling fire, reading a book on chess. A perfect picture.
"Firstly, " her voice startled him and he spilt his tea. What the fuck is it with you and tea? "I am not some little sex slave you can manipulate and use." She stood silhouetted in the doorway. She felt power rise from deep inside that had buried itself for a long time. 
"Hi, I, what are... "
"Shut up, I'm not finished. You don't get to prey on girls when they're vulnerable. I am at my lowest point right now, and I know you know that. I could fucking kill you right now. I should go to the police, only I suspect what you do is not illegal, it's just wrong. How many girls do you see in a week? How many do you promise covers to? No, don't answer that. You're just a dirty old man with a camera. I bet the queue of girls who show off for you is endless." He leaned back, a hint of a smile annoyed her. Of course he had an endless supply of pussy, he was fucking Zen.
"As a matter..." his calm voice.
"Shut up. Don't answer that. I work fucking hard. You would be lucky to have me work for you. I should not be here, but I need the money, and I want to be a model. I will do anything you want, but I won't fuck you. I decide who I fuck. Do you understand?" The look on his face, you could buy countries with that kind of pricelessness. He nodded, still that fucking patronising grin.
She wanted to tell him how she deserved to be treated better, but she suddenly knew it wasn't true. She was just one of a million girls looking for a break. His walls were covered with them. His art. He could choose anyone, but he had chosen her in that moment. That sick, perverted moment. But everyone's a rat, even him. His rat nest was not very large, but the quality of things blew her mind. Wood and brass and velvet. This rat had taste. Class even. The brass decorations and gold frames certified that he did not need to work. He lived doing what he loved. He lived. But he was a slave to his... harmless perversion. Amanda had done worse for less. Dirty old men on Sunday afternoons playing with her boobs for lunch money. She heard crying. The stupid girl was back. "I want you to know that I don't have any other options and I know that you know that. I know this is a once in a lifetime opportunity and I should do anything to take it, and I will. But I don't want you to make me feel worthless. I want to be treated with respect." Zen stopped smiling and their eyes penetrated each other, cancelling her anger and cancelling his...Zen. What did he think of her? A stupid toy? Naive young girl?
"I will." That calm voice. That Zen. "You don't have to break up with your boyfriend."
"It's too late, I already did. Now where am I sleeping?"
She dropped her bag on the couch and collapsed into the luxury. The beautiful soft leather she could drown in. He held out a cup and a plate. She took the cinnamon and walnut biscuit with her tea. That the tea and biscuit had been waiting on the table did not register. It was the best fucking biscuit she had ever tasted. They sat in silence by the fire. Amanda was a different girl. She had done it. She had killed herself.

Amanda moved in. Moved away from Jay. From her expired life. She couldn't remember the exact sequence. She cooked, cleaned, modeled. He paid her cash every week. Glorious fucking cash. Fuck you, income tax, I am the Man now. He was sometimes cruel, a bit sadistic, cheeky maybe. It was delicious. She slept with him when he wanted, without having full sex. He never tried to force the issue. If he had she wouldn't have stopped him anyway. He respected her in a way. Whatever. She made him food with the few skills of self-preservation living with a fat mother had taught her. There was no shortage of ingredients in his pantry, it was like he lived for moments. Not just food, he savoured everything. She lapped up every bit of information he shared and plied his mind for more. He knew everyone, everyone important. And more importantly everyone with a bit of money. He seemed to know everything. Her body became his tool. He knew the names of her muscles, how they worked, why they failed. Muscles and people. His tools for his art, he used them to get what he wanted. He told her what to eat and how to exercise to sculpt her body in the right places. He was a chubby guy. Not unpleasant. But not a hypocrite either. Occasionally he spanked her for fun if she did something wrong or couldn't find a pose for an emotion. Or if she messed up her makeup. It was so hot when he did that the first time she almost climaxed, but she never let him know. They had fun.
The food. Oh my god she had not tasted food like it in her life. Courgettes from France, delivered in a little wooden box by an old man with a yellow beard. Chocolate ice cream from heaven. Strange and tangy salad leaves bought from a tiny shop she had never seen with dark counters and gold lettering on the door, sold with olives so large she could barely fit them in her mouth. Wine. Wine every night. Wine with vintages, not sell-by dates. For the first time Amanda tasted life. A real life, not the shitty ratcage life of waitressing and flats and asshole mothers with cigarette butts and cheap booze. Poor people were alchoholics, rich people were lush. Her mother hadn't phoned, Amanda didn't care. I hope she's dead from starvation. Wishful thinking though, it would take that fat bitch twenty years to starve.

Monday came and so did a test shoot for Audrey magazine. It was a little online magazine with a few cool things. Boutique, they would call it, meaning it was a housewife's pet project. But housewives had little bits of money to spare in their entrepreneurial ways. Zen arranged it as a practice session. A test. To see if she had that magical something so indefinable, so important it was the difference between selling millions of products and people losing jobs. So much hinged on so little, one photo could change lives. No wonder the industry was fake, controlled. But it was art too. Emotions were bought and sold in ratty markets people thought were fashion shows.
They sent a car for her. A car, with a driver. A little old man with grey hair and a cap. He was so adorable she wanted to cover him in chocolate and eat him. And a little package for her tied up with a lace bow. Just for her. No doubt Audrey had printed out the little card herself, and done the ribbon herself. You know, to be arty. Samples from Givenchy, little bottles of fragrance from Chanel. Chocolates with a logo she had never seen before. The leather on the back seat was black, and so soft. Celebrities had fucked here, on this seat, she could feel it. The gay man at the studio door was a delightful cliche of turtleneck and attitude, he fawned over her, took her to the studio and made her feel like a million dollars and bitched about his colleagues. Coffee and bitchiness about his partner and squeeing over makeup. It was a plain shoot, just a white background with her modeling products. Nothing challenging. Stock photos. When the shoot was over it was awkward, like she wasn't needed anymore, a used tampon. So she left through the back door and took a bus back to Zen. Light rain reflected the streetlamps. The sexiness of the shoot and the travel home alone in the mist, her head on her arms looking out the window. It was wonderful. Fresh. 10 minutes later she was home.

You learned tricks from other models. An extra spoon of sugar in your coffee. Up to 5 spoons now, it was better than cocaine and stopped her craving for bread. Eat ice cream and salad, Zen told her. Sugar and starch combine to form fat. Don't eat sugar and starch together and you will stay thin, but eat them apart and you can pig out without gaining an ounce. Potatos were mostly water, no need to purge. Pee often. Jogging and water. Pole dancing at a fitness studio in town and cigarettes afterwards with the instructor who hit on her while talking about all men being scumbags. The Pole Dance instructor was an amateur model. 
"Have you heard of a photographer called Zen?"
"Of course. Bit of a pervert I hear. Best to stay away. He likes to prey on girls. They all do. Fucking men."
"Did you ever shoot with him?"
"No. We chatted once. He never asked me. He was a bit forward, and I know he has a bit of a reputation so I didn't ask him either. Who knows what might happen."
Amanda didn't tell her where she was living, just laughed inside. It could so easily have been the dancer in his home. She was beautiful, but intense. Amanda left while the pole dancer twirled alone on her pole. It was such an obvious image, so blatantly phallic, but the dancer would deny it until she died.
Amanda kept her distance from the world. Coffee and walks in town. No one knew her. Nothing had changed. But her face started appearing in small places. A little ad here, a product package there.
The small shoots became an endless cycle. Makeup, hair, light check, dressing, shooting, undressing, shooting, touchup, hair, coffee. Fake smiles and pretentious fuckheads with cameras. Lens monkeys. There were thousands of amateur photographers trying their luck. GWCs they were called. Just some guy with a camera hoping to get a girl naked. They were all the same. Drunk football jocktards with shitty cameras and no ideas. Girl on white background. Girl in dress. Girl taking off the dress. And the worst of them all, girl on motorbike. Oh my God, the guys with bikes were always the same, all going on how they would protect her from any dodgy guys, covering up their own dodginess. Whatever. If Zen said go, she went. Somewhere along the way she lost her shyness. Legs open, legs closed. Same shit, different lens. Clothed. Naked. Art. Pictures. Body. Life.

Her first shoot with Zen was incredible and she now understood why he had not photographed her from the beginning. He was a fucking genius. Every nuance, every toe and glance, he knew how to get what he wanted from her, from the makeup artist, from each fold of fabric. He didn't need fancy lights or the best camera. He just used what was there and made magic. He took a drop of hair dye and turned a glass of water into wine. She never felt like she forced a pose with him, he made her react. He conned and manilpulated her into poses before she realised what she had done. He surprised her with little things he said and he instructed her until she was perfect, but left her space to play and have fun. He knew everything. He could manipulate her like a puppet, and the thing that caught her by surprise the most was he could make her feel on command. Love for me. Cry for me. Be a desolate nymph with a dark past with a naughty streak. Yes sir. Be a bad schoolgirl. Done, I'll just remember the spankings from last week. Easy. Be a judging widow walking in the forest. No problem, I'll copy the pole dancer. Right away, Zen. Feel happy. No problem. Feel overwhelmed. Easily referenced. Whatever emotions he wanted just came through. She felt her face move at his command, her hands accentuated the pose.
His ugliness. He told her one night that was the key. When a woman responded to him it was because she had given control to his art, not because she wanted something or because he wanted something. He was an artist, and the GWCs tried to follow, but always fell short. Every time one of his images went online thousands of similar ones cropped up on model websites and in foreign fashion magazines. There were other big photographers who copied each other too, and Amanda watched how they rippled against each other, pushing and pulling for the world's attention. Looking for that next fashion. The art world fascinated her. Before meeting Zen she had no idea how interwined and incestuous art and fashion were. She surfed their ideas, rode them to the shore, and waded out and did it again.
It was not just fashion that paid her bills, there was art and commerce and a lot of experimenting. In the age of digital cameras every second person was a photographer, and Zen taught her how to squeeze a little money out of all of them. Every hour she was not earning she was losing, so she filled her hours with cheaper work and gradually traded each cheap hour for more expensive hours. It made sense. A business lesson in Zen economics. If she had been left to her own ideas she would have only pursued the one highest job and left the others. Take it all, Zen said, the small and the large.
The fashion industry ran on the illusion of adolescence. With Zen's guidance she learned to act like a teenager even off camera. The show went on when the lights were off. Don't let them feel like poedophiles even if they are. We all lusted when we were young. Never tell anyone you're in a relationship unless it's with a celebrity. Give them hope and they will give you money. If you can't give them hope give them gossip. Gossip is free publicity. Never go anywhere with someone prettier than you or they will get your jobs. Never hide your hands in a shoot, be ballet, be punk, be whatever they want, but be perfect. Every person she met thought they were original, each brand, each photographer, each iPod Shuffle Advertising Executive with a gay assistant, trying desperately to be original. But it was all the same. They were all an imitation.

Amanda and Zen were standing smoking after a shoot for a small cosmetic product from America. Something or Other. $2.99. Walmart.
"I've been watching you."
"Have you? Dirty old man."
"You, jelly bean, are almost ready for a show." Don't call me jeally bean you condescending fuck. And another thing, if you ever stop I'll kill you. 


Show #1

Most models worked the beauty circuit competing for small prizes. Miss Lower East Side, Miss Small Town, Miss Strip Mall. Amanda entered one and didn't even make the second round of judging. Wow that hurt hard, being punched in public by mini mall managers, failed models with too much makeup and botox and daughters who could never live up to their glory. Models and mothers, each one always trying to destroy the other. There there, sweetheart, you'll get the job next time, the other girls are just so much skinnier than you, perhaps we need to get you on a new diet. Controlling, destructive influences that broke a model's spirit but seemed like encouragement. Some mothers would drive their daughters for hours just to tell them the next day the job was not for them. You don't want to do the wrong sort of jobs, dear, you must never compromise. That agent had a very cheap car, dear, he won't be the right one for you. And so on. A game of lost dreams and vicarious girls.
Amanda sat in the changeroom, just a small-town fashion show for the mall, but the people running it acted like it was opening evening at New York Fashion Week. 
Everything was moving. Changing, a changing room. You looked around and a line of clothes slid away, replaced by another. Mall clothes, jeans and generic tops with minor detail. Cheap imports, knockoffs from China that were produced in India for even less. The fabric was brittle, made from plastic thread. Amanda sweated under the itchy polyester shirt, a red blouse from noname brand. Poly Cotton, it said, but even the cotton was fake. There was a stylist of sorts, a woman who probably worked at one of the stores and volunteered to work Saturday just to break the endless monotony of retail. No one knew the order things were supposed to appear; too many bosses were trying to be in charge. Models tried to get changed behind rails without revealing their gender to the other models. Idiots, Amanda thought, you're just trying to get attention. Occasionally one would shriek if a male walked near. The clothes were fragile, cheap. It was a trial to put on some of the clothes without ripping them. Amanda changed at the rail, and heard the others snigger and talk and oh my god at her bare boobs and bum. Body issues were everywhere. Everyone carried a bottle of water, the universal symbol of 'I'm trying really hard to lose weight, but...'
Chaos, everyone was panicking. The show was running late. Everyone was in charge except Amanda, she just sat and listened while someone blow-dried her hair and did her makeup. It looked worse after they finished. Whatever. Amanda just laughed secretly.
Now and again someone would come and give her instructions, who to look at, who was sitting where, what to show to who. Rodger Meyer is in seat 5, he's buying skirts this season. Be a skirt. 5 Minutes later someone else would come and tell her the opposite. Amanda waited and just let it wash over her. Zen had warned her no one knew what was going on and hopefully just before she went on stage someone would figure out what she must do. Let the chaos wash over you. Walk for the mall rats, entertain them.
It was like a boxing match. The other models were all texting, taking selfies and uploading them to all the social networks Amanda could not afford to be on. She did not even have her phone with her. Prize fighters psyching themselves up while the trainers dabbed them with towels and gave sideways glances at the opposing fighter. I have 30 seconds to seduce a whole crowd. No pressure.

There are people in life that seemed destined to cross it, and not for good reasons but for what seems like the sadistic joy of a greater being. It so happened that at Amanda's first runway show, cheap and amateurish though it was, she met a girl who truly terrified her. They were sitting waiting for the second round of frenzy, a double show with every store showcasing its old stock, when Amanda, clumsy little girl, spilled blue nailpolish on another model's dress. A small splash spilled onto her neck as well. The model, a girl 300 feet tall, clearly from an upperclass family, gave a shriek and started what appeared to be a panic attack, and more shrieks. Her life was ruined, how dare Amanda do this to her, Amanda had done it on purpose. A tirade so long and tedious it was beyond description. Amanda apologised, but it was a small and insignificant apology and the blue-stained girl clearly wanted some greater judgement for the vile crime. Amanda took a tissue and tried to wipe off the spot. This was a bad move, it turned out; the spot turned into an ugly smear. Dress ruined. No great loss to the fashion world, but the model erupted.
"What the actual..."
And they were swept up in the chaos of the show.
